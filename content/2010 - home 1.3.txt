DigitalHome Requirements Specification
1. Introduction
This document specifies the requirements for the development of a “Smart
House”, called DigitalHome (DH), by the DigitalHomeOwner Division of
HomeOwner Inc. A “Smart House” is a home management system that allows
home residents to easily manage their daily lives by providing for a lifestyle that
brings together security, environmental and energy management (temperature,
humidity and lighting), entertainment, and communications. The Smart House
components consist of household devices (e.g., a heating and air conditioning
unit, a security system, and small appliances and lighting units, etc.), sensors
and controllers for the devices, communication links between the components,
and a computer system, which will manage the components.
The DigitalHome Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is based on the
DigitalHome Customer Need Statement. It is made up of a list of the principal
features of the system. This initial version of DigitalHome will be a limited
prototype version, which will be used by HomeOwner management to make
business decisions about the future commercial development of
DigitalHomeOwner products and services. Hence, the SRS is not intended as a
comprehensive or complete specification of DigitalHome requirements. There is
a supplementary document that provides additional detail and information about
the DigitalHome requirements: the Digital Home Use Case Model [HO2010].
These document were prepared by the DigitalHomeOwner Division, in
consultation with the Marketing Division of HomeOwner Inc.

3. Overall description
3.1 Product Description and Scope
The Digital Home system, for the purposes of this document, is a system that will
allow a home user to manage devices that control the environment of a home.
The user communicates through a personal web page on the DigitalHome web
server or on a local home server. The DH web server communicates, through a
home wireless gateway device, with the sensor and controller devices in the
home.
The product is based on the Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition
[HLRD 2010] is intended as a prototype, which will allow business decisions to
be made about future development of a commercial product. The scope of the
project will be limited to the management of devices which control temperature,
humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units, through the
use of a web-ready device. The prototype DH software system will be situated in
a simulated environment. There will be no actual physical home and all sensors
and controllers will be simulated.
3.2 Users Description
3.2.1 DigitalHome Users
3.2.1.1 The general user shall be able to use the DH system
capabilities to monitor and control the environment in his/her
home.
3.2.1.2 The general user is familiar with the layout of his/her home and
the location of sensor and control devices (for temperature, for
humidity, and for power to small appliances and lighting units).
3.2.1.3 Although the general user is not familiar with the technical
features of the DH system, he/she is familiar with the use of a
web interface and can perform simple web operations (logging
in and logging out, browsing web pages, and submitting
information and requests via a web interface).
3.2.1.4 A Master user will be designated, who shall be able to change
the configuration of the system. For example, a Master User
shall be able to add a user account or change the default
parameter settings. He/she will have the same right as the DH
Technician, described in section 3.2.2.4.
3.2.2 DigitalHome Technician
Digital Home Project, SRS 1.3
Page 6
3.2.2.1 A DH Technician is responsible for setting up and maintaining
the configuration of a DH system.
3.2.2.2 A DH Technician has experience with the type of hardware,
software, and web services associated with a system like the
DH system.
3.2.2.3 A DH Technician is specially trained by DigitalHomeOwner to be
familiar with the functionality, architecture, and operation of the
DH system product.
3.2.2.4 A DH Technician will have rights beyond the DH General User,
capable of setting up and making changes in the configuration
of the system (e.g.,setting system parameters and establishing
user accounts), and starting and stopping operation of the DH
System.
3.3 Development Constraints
3.3.1 The “prototype” version of the DigitalHome System (as specified in this
document) must be completed within twelve months of inception.
3.3.2 The development team will consist of five engineers. The
DigitalHomeOwner Director will provide management and
communication support.
3.3.3 The development team will use the development process specified by
the Digital HomeOwner Inc.
3.3.4 Where possible, the DigitalHome project will employ widely used,
accepted, and available hardware and software technology and
standards, both for product elements and for development tools. See
section 3.4 for additional detail.
3.3.5 Because of potential market competition for DigitalHome products, the
cost of DigitalHome elements (sensors, controllers, server, tools, etc.),
for this project should be minimized. As part of the final project report
the development team will describe their efforts to minimize costs,
including price comparisons between DH elements and
comparable/competitive elements.
3.3.6 The DH system will be tested in a simulated environment. There will be
no actual physical home and all sensors and controllers will be
simulated. However, the simulated environment will be realistic and
adhere to the physical properties and constraints of an actual home
and to real sensors and controllers.
3.3.7 Major changes to this document (e.g., changes in requirements) must
be approved by the Director of the DigitalHomeOwner Division.
3.4 Operational Environment

help Homeowner Inc. to make marketing and development decisions, the
following sections describe operational environment concerns and constraints;

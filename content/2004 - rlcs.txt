1. Introduction
1.1. Purpose
This document defines the application software requirements for the Interstate -15 Reversible Lane
Control System (I-15 RLCS).
The RLCS application software (‘RLCS Application’) will meet all of the software requirements listed in
this document, and if any changes are made to the original set of requirements, this document will
reflect those changes upon approval of project management and the appropriate stakeholders.
1.2. Scope
The purpose of the (I-15 RLCS) is to open and close the reversible lanes for morning and evening peak
traffic hours and any special events defined by operators of the system. The software developed from
this specification will replace the current aging and non-expandable RLCS Application.  In addition, new
controller devices, as well as field device interface cards will be provided by the successful bidder, and
the software will  interface with these new field hardware components via interfaces to driver software.

2. Overall description
This section describes the general factors that affect the RLCS Application software requirements.  This
section does not state specific requirements, instead it provides a background for those requirements,
which are defined in detail in Section 3.
The RLCS Application will allow an operator to view system status and issue commands to change
device status as well as configure the system and generate reports. The five major functions of the
RLCS application software are a Graphical User Interface (GUI), Process Control and Monitoring,
Sequencing, Data Processing and Security, and Reporting.
2.1. Product perspective
This section describes how the RLCS Application software relates to other systems and software as
well as how it functions internally.
2.1.1. External System Interfaces
2.1.1.1. In addition to providing data to the system users and traffic operations
management, the RLCS Application will provide data to other external systems
via an external server data store accessible by other external systems such as
ATMS-2, ValuePricing/FasTrak, and ATIS.
2.1.1.2. The RLCS Application will also allow for remote access through a firewall via
outside telecommunications networks by authorized users.

2.1.2. User Interface
The user will operate the RLCS Application software using a graphical user interface.
2.1.3. Hardware Interfaces
RLCS application will seamlessly interface and control hardware devices.
2.1.4. Software Interfaces
This section discusses interfaces between the RLCS application and other software, which may
include but are not limited to: Workstation O/S, Network O/S, Controller O/S, a database
management system, and a reporting tool
2.1.5. Communications Interfaces
The RLCS will provide access to system status data, to external systems through a firewall.
This will be a one way data transfer to a computer outside of the RLCS network and making it
available there for public use. The transfer will occur every 30 seconds. A  one way serial data
transfer will also be provided.
RLCS workstations and controllers will reside on a private network to communicate  field device
information.
The RLCS private network communication media will include fiber, Cat 5 wiring  Leased lines
and dial-up lines
Communications from the TMC to the DCU controllers is through the FCU controller.
In addition, wireless connections between the FCU and DCU controllers are not an option due
to security and interference considerations
2.1.6. Memory constraints
The only memory constraints imposed on the software will depend on constraints associated
with the intelligent controller selected for the system.  For the 2070 controller, reference the
TEES document in Appendix E.
2.1.7. Operations
The RLCS Application will support the operations described in ‘Section 2.8 Operational Scenarios’ of
the RLCS System Requirements Specification..
2.1.8. Site Adaptation
The RLCS Application will operate as a component of the RLCS System, for which physical adaptations
are described in ‘Section 3.7 Physical’ of the System Requirements Specification

2.3. User characteristics
Several classes of users will access the RLCS Application.  A user is defined as anyone who has the
ability to ‘log on’ to the RLCS.  External entities such as ATMS and ValuePricing, which will retrieve
data from a server external to the RLCS network, are not considered users.  Also, the driving public will
have access to system status via the changeable message signs, and eventually the Traveler
Information Network, but are also not considered users of the system.

Security setup capabilities are defined in more detail in Section 3.
2.4. Constraints
The following constraints were factors in the development of the detailed requirements for the
RLCS Application:
a) Regulatory policies – There were no technical regulatory policies specifically covering the RLCS
Application.
b) Hardware limitations –  The RLCS Application will reside on a hardware platform compatible with
Microsoft Windows NT or Unix-based operating systems.
c) Interfaces to other applications – Other than system level interfaces, such as network, operating
system, and database system, there will be no interfaces to other applications.
d) Parallel operation – For a short time, while the RLCS Application is being deployed  in the field,
the existing system will be left in place and will only be disconnected after a successful, complete
system test in the field during hours when the facility is closed to traffic.
e) Audit functions – The RLCS Application will  create and store log files which will track all

application activity.
f) Higher-order language requirements – There are no specific high level language requirements,
other than that a high level language be used to develop and maintain the  RLCS Application for
more cost-effective maintenance efforts.
g) Reliability requirements – The  RLCS Application must be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per
week, 365 days per year.
h) Criticality of the application – The RLCS Application is important to the traffic management goals
of the Southern California region.  Opening the lanes in the direction of the peak traffic flow to route
traffic onto the reversible   lanes is a critical operation in meeting these goals.
i) Safety and security considerations – The safety of field maintenance staff and the traveling public
is dependent on the correct functioning of the RLCS Application to open and close the facility.
Reversible Lanes facilities, whether operated manually, or by a control system, present a
fundamental risk: The risk is the possibility of opening an entrance for one direction of travel, with
one or more entrances already open in the opposite direction.
Should this type of event actually occur, it would be nothing less than catastrophic; for the motorists
involved; for the traveling public in general, for the system operators, and for the Agency.
Another potential control system risk, lies with the barrier gates used at Locations 1, 2, and 5.
Should one of these gates be lowered across an otherwise open entrance, the results could be
catastrophic.
There are less serious, but possibly more common control system risks in closure device/sensor
failures during the opening or closing of an entrance.
In the absence of full system overrides, if the system allows, or causes, an entrance to be opened
in one direction, when an entrance in the opposite direction is open, then the system has failed.
A well designed, carefully implemented, and thoroughly tested control system, can reduce the
chance of such an occurrence (due to operator error, control system or sensor failure).
In order to achieve this, the nature of the risk must  be understood  and continually kept in mind by
control system developers and testers.
2.5. Assumptions and dependencies
The RLCS will benefit from the deployment of the Fiber Optic Network along I-15 Reversible Lane
corridor to include the RLCS lanes. The communications between the FCU and DCU locations will
continue to be copper. The primary mode of communication is fiber and secondary is ISDN. The fail
over will be transparent to the RLCS application.

A dialup connection will be used for remote access to the RLCS.
2.6. Apportioning of the requirements
The RLCS software will not be apportioned, or split between multiple releases.  The complete set of
requirements will be included in one release.

3. Specific Requirements
This section of the SRS contains the RLCS Application software requirements to a level of detail
sufficient to enable designers to design the system, and acceptance testers to test that the system
satisfies the requirements.
These software requirements will be revised by the contractor to reflect the final approved RLCS
architecture design. This will be done before high-level software design phase.
Every stated requirement is externally perceivable by users, operators, or other external systems.
This section describes each input into the software, every output from the software, and all functions
performed by the software.
3.1.  External Interface requirements
3.1.1. Hardware Interfaces
Multiple field devices will interface with updated device input/output cards that in turn will interface with
an intelligent controller.  It is unknown at this time which particular controller will be used to control the
field devices, but the software must interface with whichever controller is chosen to interface with the
field devices.  The field devices and controllers in the table on the following page are currently in use at
the facility. See Appendix D for a table of current FCU-DCU and FCU-CMS interface pin configurations.
3.1.1.1 Field Device I/O Drivers
The RLCS software shall send to and receive data from the field device I/O cards through I/O
driver software.

3.2.2. Process Monitoring and Control
The RLCS software will monitor the status of all field devices and will process requests for changing
field device status.
Input Entities (from list of entities and attributes in 3.4 Logical Database Requirements): Alarm Type,
Command Level, Device, Device Alarm Criteria, Device Command, Device Rules, Device Status,
Diagnostic Command, Location, System Control Parameters, System Mode, System Operation Status,
System Operational Command
Output Entities: Alarm Type, Command Level, Device, Device Command, Device Command Log,
Diagnostic Command, Location, Operator Daily Diary Log, System Operation Command Log, System
Operation Command Log, System Operation Status, System Operational Command
3.2.2.1 The RLCS  shall monitor all field device sensors, and shall process operator
requests for changing field device status.
3.2.2.2 Any operator or system command, which changes the state of field control
devices, must be checked for integrity at multiple levels in the RLCS.
3.2.2.3 The RLCS software shall monitor, display, and update the database with the status
of all system field elements.  Any change in device state shall be reported on the
screen not later than 2 seconds from the time it occurs.  In addition to monitoring
field devices the system shall also monitor field controllers and  connected on the
RLCS network for control system integrity. The system shall report any users logged
in RLCS network computers any time and all commands issued in the field units.
3.2.2.4 During ‘degraded’ mode, the system shall monitor device sensors at the frequency
rate stored in the database to take effect only during ‘degraded’ mode. In general,
the system shall monitor the status of all field devices at the frequency specified in
the System Control Parameters for that mode.
3.2.2.4.1 The system shall control all system field elements to device sensor level for
those device sensors that may be controlled.  For example, the temperature
sensor at the controller cabinet is not a controllable sensor, whereas the ‘gate
arm control lines’ sensor may be controlled.
3.2.2.4.2 Each device control command shall check the current status of all closure
devices in the system and shall abort if any closure control device status is
unknown.
3.2.2.4.3 Each command (at the device sensor command, device command(macro), or
system operational command (super macro) level) shall only be executed
when a valid or good status  exists for all device sensors. An authorized  user
shall be able to log in and issue device status requests and control
commands from specified computers in  the network.  (This is determined

based on the user’s access level and authorized workstations.)
3.2.2.4.4 The current status for all devices shall be maintained at each controller unit.
3.2.2.4.5 Alarms
Check Device Status for Alarm Condition
Each status received from device sensors shall be checked against alarm
conditions for that device sensor and the status will be updated to indicate an
alarm.
3.2.2.4.6 Critical alarms shall be generated when one or more of these conditions are
met.
1) A closure device changes from a known state to unknown state (status lost)
2) A closure device changes from legal state to illegal state. E.g. pop-ups in
the down position when they are supposed to be up.
3) The control system Integrity verification indicates a verification failure.
4) When a user logs in any of the field units.
5) When a command to override a device has been issued anywhere in the
system.
6) When there is a communication failure within the RLCS network
7) When a computer in the RLCS network goes down
8) Power failure at any controller or workstation
9) When a cabinet ID is changed.
10) When the DCUs are in manual mode.
11) Watch Dog timer failure
3.2.2.4.7 Warning alarms shall be generated when one or more of these conditions are
met.
1)  security sensor activation at either the FCU or DCU.
2)  When Air pressure, Temperature in cabinets, and Voltages are outside the
limits of established  thresholds as stored in the database.
3.2.2.4.8 If a critical alarm occurs during opening or closing operation, the system shall
present the operator with possible actions that can be taken in order to
complete the operation.  If overriding a device status is needed in order to
proceed, the system shall determine if the operator has high enough security
and provide advise on how to proceed.
3.2.2.4.9 Process GUI Commands
3.2.2.4.9.1 In order for a command to be processed from any workstation or
controller, the MCU field device shall be in the “Auto” mode.
3.2.2.4.9.2 The system operator shall be able to override any device and continue
with a system operational command sequence. To ‘override’ a device
means to set the status to a normal value even if the device is not
functioning in order to continue with a sequence.   Field staff would
manually operate any device that is not responding to a controller
Department of Transportation District 11
I-15 RLCS Software Requirements Specification
April 21, 2004                                                               Section VID page 26 of 66
command prior to the operator ‘overriding’ the device status.
3.2.2.4.9.3 The process of overriding a device status shall not affect the status of any
other device.
3.2.2.4.9.4 Business Rules / Interlocks / Safety Screening
Each control command that is processed must be validated against the
secured  safety rules (stored in non-volatile memory) for the command.
For example, if the operator issues a command to open the south gate
while the north gate is open, the RLCS software will determine that
opening the south gate cannot occur when the north gate is open, and will
give an indication that the operation cannot be completed. The validation
will occur at each control unit in the system that receives the command.
3.2.2.4.9.5 Commands are only forwarded from superior units to inferior ones.  This
prevents a lower level unit from changing the state of a device which is
controlled by either a higher level unit, or by a peer unit. The TSU is
superior to the FCUs which are superior to the DCUs.
3.2.2.5 Track and log all Failed Requests for Device Status and Control
3.2.2.5.1 If a status from any device is not received upon request, the system shall
automatically request the status again.
3.2.2.5.2 Failure to receive a valid status after a configurable number of retries shall be
considered a device failure.
3.2.2.6 Identify units and Initialize all Devices
3.2.2.6.1 When each workstation and control unit (workstation or intelligent controller at
the FCU or DCU) comes online, the system shall identify it and all its associated device
sensors.
3.2.2.6.2 The RLCS software  shall initialize each control unit and device sensor as
it is identified.
3.2.2.6.2.1 RLCS Software Startup PROCESS:   The RLCS software in the field
shall  first identify the its unit  when it starts,  by reading the cabinet
id.  The RLCS software will then proceed to make sure that all the
cards required in that unit are present and working properly. The
RLCS software will do a control system integrity check ( see
requirement 3.0.9) and initialize all the specified tables.  If everything
is OK the start  up process shall not exceed 30 seconds. The RLCS
software shall then monitor all the devices and send the current
status to the FCU or TSU every 2 seconds (or at the rate specified in
the System Control Parameters for the current mode).

3.2.2.7  The RLCS software shall be designed to allow for future changes to the roadway
without requiring  programming effort. Updating non-volatile memory-based tables  shall
be sufficient to accommodate future changes to the roadway.  Some examples of future
changes to the facility include, change in the number of closure devices. change in the
number of entrances to lanes, change in the number of changeable message signs,
Different closure devices, and different operational procedures.
3.2.2.8 Collect Log Data
The system shall generate log files as follows for reports:
3.2.2.8.1 Device Command Log: Contains device commands issued with time
stamp, operator ID, unit where the command was issued at and shall
include failed or aborted commands. Device command log shall not be
editable by users.
3.2.2.8.1.1 System Operation Command Log: Contains system operational
commands issued with time stamp, operator ID, unit where the
command was issued at and shall include failed or aborted
commands. System Operation command shall not be editable by
users
3.2.2.8.1.2 The Problem Work Order Log will be generated automatically with
failure information at the time of failure. Some input fields in this log
will allow the operator to input status and emergency notification
information.
3.2.2.8.1.3 Alarm Log will contain information about warning and critical alarm
events.
3.2.2.8.1.4 The Daily Diary Log will be generated automatically when a user with
Operator authority logs on to the system.  Some input fields in this
log will allow the operator to input free form text information.
3.2.2.8.1.5 Special Event Log: This log will contain information about scheduled
special events.
3.2.2.8.1.6 System Operation Schedule Log: This log contains information about
scheduled operations.

3.2.3.2 The RLCS shall present scheduled command operations to the operator at the
GUI for confirmation prior to executing the command.
3.2.3.3 At any point in an opening or closing sequence, the sequence shall be halted if:
3.2.3.3.1 A device fails to report completion of the current sequence step  within
the response time window allotted for the step, or
3.2.3.3.2 The status of a closure device, which was previously opened at the
current entrance, changes to ‘unknown’ or ‘closed’, without an

3.2.4 Data Processing and Security
The RLCS shall store, process, and retrieve all data necessary to operate the application software as
well as generate current and historical reports of system operations, and export system status data to
an external server data store. The RLCS shall also store, process, and retrieve all data necessary to
secure the system from unauthorized use. A commercial off-the-shelf database management system
shall be used for this function.
The RLCS database stores information needed to operate the RLCS as well as historical transaction
data to generate reports of system operations.
Input Entities (from list of entities and attributes in 3.4 Logical Database Requirements): All entities
Output Entities: All entities
3.2.4.1 The RLCS application software shall update and read database tables to support
system operations.
3.2.4.2 The RLCS application software shall Update and read password and device rule
data in encrypted format.
3.2.4.3 Update and read Security information
The Personnel Security Level entity stores information about the five  attributes used
to restrict access to the RLCS:  Command Level, Device, Mode, Workstation, and
System Functions.
3.2.4.4 Command levels are of three types:  ‘Status Only’, ‘Control’, and ‘Override’.  Users
with ‘Status Only’ command level security may not issue any control commands at
any level (device, macro, or super macro). ‘Control’ allows a user to issue control
commands, and is a higher level of security. ‘Override’ allows a user to temporarily
change the status of a device in the database for a configurable period of time in
order to allow a command sequence to continue.
Commands shall be classified in these categories
(1) Device control commands.  These are single commands that change the state of a
device. Example: Raise gate at location 1
(2) Device Macro Commands.  This is a group of two or more sequentially executed
commands that change the states of two or more closure devices.  Example Close
CMS 1 through 4.
(3) Super Macro Commands. This is a group of two or more sequentially executed
macros  that change the states of an Entrance.  Example Close South end Location
2.
(4) Override Commands.  These are commands that force the status of a device to a
temporary known state for the purpose of completing an operation which otherwise

I-15 RLCS Software Requirements Specification
April 21, 2004                                                               Section VID page 30 of 66
would not be completed if the device remained in an unknown state. This type of
command changes the database value for the device only and does not send a
device command to the field device.
(5)  Device Status Commands.  These are commands that request the status of a
device. Example Get status of DCU1, or get the status of CMS12.
(6) Diagnostic Commands. These are commands that run diagnostic on devices or
controllers. Example: Run diagnostics on the communication card in DCU1.
3.2.4.5 The system shall will employ a one-way hash function as an aid to maintaining the
integrity of the data and software in the field.  The hash value returned by the
function shall will be at least 128 bits in length.  The MD5 algorithm is acceptable for
this purpose.
3.2.4.5.1 At each time, one or more of the above item types, listed under ‘Control Unit
Non-Volatile Memory’, is created or modified, a UTC date/time stamp shall
will be updated. The update of the time stamp shall will be the last step in the
process which builds the time stamped code/data section.
3.2.4.5.2 The system shall will also, for each control unit in the system,  produce a
table of the returned ‘one-way hash function’ (Message Digest) values, of
each of the ‘Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory’ items.  The returned ‘Message
Digest’ values shall will be stored as hexadecimal characters.  The
appropriate ‘Message Digest’ table shall will be maintained in  non-volatile
memory in each system control unit.
3.2.4.5.3 The system will provide for periodic verification that current, recomputed
‘Message Digest’ values, for each unit in the system, correspond with ‘record’
values computed by the development processMD5 algorithm.  The periodic
evaluation shall will occur at least once a day.  The ‘Message Digest’ value
verification results shall will be recorded in the system log.  A verification
failure shall will cause an alarm condition for the affected control unit.  If the
failure occurs in checking the non-volatile memory items, the system shall will
prevent the affected unit from being used in control sequences.
3.2.4.5.4 The system shall will provide for ‘Message Digest’ verification requests for a
given unit by operator command.
3.2.4.5.5 For system login purposes, the hash function shall will also be used to
encrypt user passwords.   [Harrison to ask Don Day why these are
requirements.]
3.2.4.5.6 To change device command rules on the production system, the System
Administrator must upload a new database version after testing the rule
changes in the Simulator environment.

3.3 Performance
3.3.1 External Interfaces
Priority:  Must have
3.3.1.1 The external server data store containing RLCS status for use by external
systems shall be updated once per minute.
3.3.1.2 The field device status information logging to the database  shall be 2 seconds,
but can be configurable within the database to more than 2 seconds by the user.
3.3.1.3 The field device status information display update frequency shall be 2 seconds,
but can be configurable within the database to more than 2 seconds by the user.
3.3.1.4 The RLCS shall receive device status information from devices sensors within 2
seconds of the status information being issued by the device sensor.
3.3.1.5 Field devices shall receive respond to commands from the RLCS within 12
seconds of the command confirmation being issued by the operator using a
keyboard (or other input device).
3.3.2 User Interface (GUI)
Priority: Must have
3.3.2.1 The  RLCS shall support multiple users logged on, up to the limit of the number
of users defined in the database.
3.3.2.2 Not including device and network response times, requests from the GUI for
status updates shall not exceed 2 seconds to update the GUI display.
Not including device and network response time, requests from the GUI for device status
changes (control commands) shall not exceed 2 seconds.
3.3.2.3 The facility map on the screen shall refresh every 2 seconds but can be
configurable within the database to more than 2 seconds by the user.
3.3.2.4 The RLCS notification to the operator workstation of any critical alarms shall
occur within 2 seconds of alarm detection, and shall occur whether or not an
operator is logged on to the system.
3.3.3 Process Monitoring and Control
Priority: Must have
3.3.3.1 The field units (controllers) shall continually monitor device status, controller
status and the control system integrity and send the status to the central

computer in the TMC every 2 seconds or less.
3.3.3.2 The RLCS shall detect alarm conditions within 2 seconds of occurrence.
3.3.4 Sequencing
Priority: Must have
3.3.4.1 At a minimum of every  60 seconds, the system shall check the current date and
time against a list of scheduled events for the current mode to determine if any
event should be executed.
3.3.4.2 The  RLCS shall support at a minimum the 4 daily ‘normal’ mode open and close
scheduled operations plus at least the same number of ‘emergency’ and
‘maintenance’ mode scheduled events.
3.3.5 Data Processing and Security
Priority: Must have
The database retrieval and update response time shall not impact any other performance
requirements such as the GUI response time or monitoring and control responses. In other
words, the database performance is a component of the total response time for any other
performance requirement. If the GUI is required to reflect change in status within 2 seconds,
then the database update time must be less than 2 seconds.
3.3.6 Reporting
Priority: Must have
3.3.6.1 The operator shall be able to store and retrieve previously created report results from
the RLCS for a minimum period of 60 days, but configurable for up to one year.
3.3.6.2 The raw data used to create reports shall be kept in the  RLCS for a minimum period of
13 months prior to backing up to tapes or other secondary storage media.
3.3.6.3 Report processing shall not impact any other performance requirements such as the
GUI response time or monitoring and control responses
3.3.6.4 Report response time shall be determined by the database resources allocated to the
reporting function. Depending on user needs for fast report response times (such as for ad hoc
reporting), database extracts may be created for reporting purposes only.
3.3.7 Communications
Priority: Must have
3.3.7.1 RLCS system components will communicate via the private communications
networks established by Department of Transportation District 11 prior to the
development of the RLCS. Any operator or system command, which changes the
state of field control devices, must be checked for integrity at multiple levels in

the system.  Valid checksum algorithms must be employed to check the integrity
of messages between units.
3.3.7.2 The RLCS must support the following data transfer performance goals:
The number of kbits transmitted for a single polling event of all device sensors is estimated to be:
# of sensors x bytes/status command x 8bits/byte x 1k/1000=
205 x 200 x 8 x 1/1000= 328 kbits
The transmission rate required to transfer this data in 2 seconds is: 328 kbits/2 sec. = 164 kbits/s
At a 30 second polling interval, the transmission rate drops to 10.9 kbits/s.
# of Sensors* Bytes per status command Polling Interval Transmission Rate (kbits/second)
205 200 2 164
205 200 30 10.9
*The # of sensors is the total # of sensors in Exhibit 3.2a and Exhibit 3.2b combined.
Polling all system devices constitutes the majority (over 99.99%) of transactions on the network.  The
opening and closing sequences that occur four times daily, add only a small fraction to the total system
load.
At 164 kbits/s, in a 24-hour period, 14,169,600k bits will travel over the network:
(164 kbits/sec) x (60 sec/min) x (60 min/hr) x (24 hrs/day)  = 14,169,600k bits/day
The following chart shows the number of kbits added by the daily opening and closing operations,
which represent only 0.009% of the daily system load: (1,312 / 14,169,600 = 0.00009)

April 21, 2004                                                               Section VID page 58 of 66
Appendix F – Initial System Configuration Data for Operational Sequences
and System Modes
This section describes  the RLCS operational requirements which are critical to designing  a safe
control system. This section also lays down operational rules, which the software must implement and
adhere to.
F.1 Open Entrances
RLCS facility entrances allow vehicles to enter from the adjacent main lanes of I-15 or SR-163.  Each
entrance serves only one direction of travel (either Northbound, or Southbound).  Each entrance is, as
necessary, opened in order to allow access to the facility, or closed in order to either close the facility,
or open it in the opposing direction.
RLCS facility exits, used by vehicles to exit the facility, are always open and have no control devices
associated with them.
In the direction of travel on the freeway, RLCS facility entrance closure devices consist of:
1. Changeable Message Signs (CMS)
2. Entrance Longitudinal Pop-ups
3. Entrance Transverse Pop-ups
4. Barrier Gates
5. Wrong Way Transverse Pop-ups
6. Wrong Way Longitudinal Pop-ups
Operation of each closure device will entail one or more commands from its associated control unit.
Each command, which operates a single closure device, shall have a specific ‘response time window’
defined for successful command completion.  In addition, each compound command, which includes
more than one ‘single device’ command, shall have a specific ‘response time window’ defined for
successful command completion of the compound command.
The control system must not attempt to open any entrance closure device, if the status of any opposite
direction entrance closure device is ‘unknown’ or open’.
Steps within a command, or command group, shall be executed sequentially, whether the individual
commands in a group, will be executed by one (1) control unit, or by more than one control unit.
F.2 Roadway Closure Device Status
The current status of all entrance closure devices in the system must be maintained at each control
unit.  The state of the closure devices shall be updated in all control units. The update frequency shall
be higher during the opening and closing periods. Closure device sensors shall be monitored
continuously by their local control unit.  The  status should be forwarded immediately to all other control
units in the system.
F.3 Opening Sequences
Opening sequences must open Entrance devices in the following order:
1. Barrier Gate

April 21, 2004                                                               Section VID page 59 of 66
2. Wrong Way Transverse Pop-ups
If more than one bank, banks are opened in the direction from the freeway toward the
reversible lanes.
3. Wrong Way Longitudinal Pop-ups
Pop-up banks are opened beginning at the entrance ramp nose at the reversible lanes,
and proceeding toward the edge of shoulder.
4. Entrance Transverse Pop-ups
If more than one bank, the banks are opened in the direction from the reversible lanes
toward the freeway.
5. Entrance Longitudinal Pop-ups
Pop-up banks are opened downstream (entrance ramp nose at the freeway) to upstream
6. CMS(edge of shoulder).
CMS messages will be changed from a ‘Closed’ message, to an ‘Open’ message
beginning with the furthest downstream sign (sign closest to the reversible lane), and
proceeding upstream (away from the reversible lanes) as message change
confirmations are received from each sign.
At any point in an opening sequence, the sequence shall be halted if:
• A device fails to report completion of the current sequence step  within the response
time window allotted for the step, or
• The status of a  closure device for the opposite direction of travel changes to ‘unknown’
or ‘open’, or
• The status of a closure device, which was previously opened at the current entrance,
changes to ‘unknown’ or ‘closed’.
F.4 Closing Sequences
Closing sequences must close Entrance devices in the following order:
1. CMS
CMS messages will be changed from “Open” to “Closed” beginning with the farthest
upstream sign (furthest away from the entrance) and proceeding, in order, downstream
(towards the entrance).  The system shall provide for a specific delay between the
message change on each sign and the message change on the next downstream sign.
The delay for each sign pair shall equal the time to travel between the two signs at a
system specified speed.
2. Entrance Longitudinal Pop-ups
Entrance Longitudinal Pop-ups must be closed in the direction of adjacent freeway traffic
( beginning at the shoulder edge and proceeding toward the entrance ramp nose).
3. Entrance Transverse Pop-ups
If more than one bank, Entrance Transverse Pop-ups will be closed in the direction from
the freeway toward the reversible lanes.
4. Wrong Way Longitudinal Pop-ups
Wrong Way Longitudinal Pop-ups will be closed beginning at the shoulder edge, and
progressing toward the ramp nose, next to the reversible lanes.
5. Wrong Way Transverse Pop-ups
If more than one bank, Wrong Way Transverse Pop-ups will be closed in the direction
from the reversible lanes toward the freeway.

6. Barrier Gate
At any point in a closing sequence, the sequence shall be halted if either:
1. A device fails to report completion of the current sequence step within the response time
window allotted for the step, or
2. The status for a closure device, which was previously closed at the current entrance,
changes to ‘unknown’ or ‘open’.
F.5 ‘Halted’ Opening and Closing Sequences
A ‘halted’ opening or closing sequence shall cause the system to enter a ‘hold’ state for a system
specified time.  If the offending device status can be corrected within the specified time period, the
operator shall be able to enter a ‘resume’ command in order for the system to attempt to complete the
original opening/closing sequence.
F.6 Multiple Entrances
If multiple entrances exist on the reversible lanes in the direction of travel being opened, the specific
order in which those entrances are opened presents no ‘wrong way’ safety issues.  Likewise, if multiple
entrances exist on the reversible lanes in the direction of travel being closed, the specific order in which
those entrances are closed presents no ‘wrong way’ safety issues.
F.7 Safety Screening of Commands
Safety screening shall be done to determine if execution of a proposed command, if successful, would
produce a valid reversible lanes configuration.   If the screened command, including any subordinate
commands would result in an unacceptable  reversible lanes configuration, the screening check is
considered to have failed.
In the following section, the term ‘device command’ shall be understood to include any simple
command, command group, or macro, which may, if executed, change the state of one or more
entrance devices.
In the case of device command groups (macros, compound commands, etc.) any screening
requirement shall be applied to the command group, and to each device command within the group,
prior to execution.
Each instance of safety screening shall utilize system configuration data that is no more than 3 seconds
old.
Safety screening of device commands shall be multi-layered.
1. Safety screening shall be applied to all device commands at the originating control
unit, and at all subordinate control units to which the device command or any of its
subordinate device commands may be forwarded.
2. Safety screening shall always be applied to any device command, or command step,
by any control unit which directly operates the target entrance closure device(s), just
prior to actual command execution.

An opening or closing sequence shall be halted, with an appropriate error response to the system
operator, if, at any sequence step, command safety screening fails.
F.8 Control System Integrity
Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory
In each FCU and DCU  in the system, the following items shall be replicated from the central database
server and maintained in  non-volatile, non-removable memory:
Login Tables
Closure Device Timing Parameters
Air Calibration Factors
Reversible Lanes Configuration Table(s)
Reversible Lanes Operating Logic, Control Sequences, and Rule Sets
F.9 Control System Integrity Verification
The system shall will employ a one-way hash function as an aid to encrypting and maintaining the
integrity of the data and software in the field.  The hash value returned by the function shall will be at
least 128 bits in length.  The MD5 algorithm is acceptable for this purpose. This algorithm shall  reside
in all the controllers and the application server.
At each time, one or more of the above item types, listed under ‘Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory’, is
created or modified, a UTC date/time stamp shall will be appended to the code (or table). The
appending of the time stamp shall will be the last step in the process which builds the time stamped
code/data section.
The system shall will also, for each control unit in the system,  produce a table of the returned ‘one-way
hash function’ (Message Digest) values, of each of the ‘Control Unit Non-Volatile Memory’ items.  The
returned ‘Message Digest’ values shall will be stored as hexadecimal characters.  The appropriate
‘Message Digest’ table shall will be maintained in  non-volatile memory in each system control unit.
The system will provide for periodic verification that current, recomputed ‘Message Digest’ values, for
each unit in the system, correspond with ‘record’ values computed by the development process.  The
periodic evaluation shall will occur at least once a day.  The ‘Message Digest’ value verification results
shall will be recorded in the system log.  A verification failure shall will cause an alarm condition for the
affected control unit.  If the failure occurs in checking the non-volatile memory items, the system shall
will prevent the affected unit from being used in control sequences.
The system shall will provide for ‘Message Digest’ verification requests for a given unit by operator
command.
For system login purposes, the hash function shall will also be used to encrypt user passwords.
The system will provide for password aging.  Whether or not the system will require password aging
shall will be controllable by the System Administrator.
The system will provide for minimum username and password lengths.  The minimum length values
shall will be controllable by the system administrator.

F.10 Access and Safety Characteristics of the I-15 Reversible Roadway
The software must implement.
Characteristics Bearing on Security
1. Isolation –
System commands may be entered only at a control unit console following logon.  Command
pathways are hard-wired, and not shared with other devices or systems.  The current state of
the roadway may be transmitted from the upper control unit (TSU) to another system via a one-
way serial link.  The Reversible Lane Control System does not accept or process any input from
other systems.
2. Closure Device Status Circulation –
The current state of each roadway closure device and device status change is circulated to all
control units in the system, every 2 seconds.
3. Command Forwarding –
Commands are only forwarded from superior units to inferior  units.  This prevents a lower level
unit from changing the state of a device which is controlled by either a higher level unit, or by a
peer unit.
4. Command Processing –
Device control units utilize device feedback, coupled with strict response time windows for
device opening and closing commands.
5. Uncertain status –
Unknown, or improper closure device status anywhere in the system, will immediately terminate
a ‘device opening’ command.  Improper device status ‘may’ terminate a device closing
command, or sequence.

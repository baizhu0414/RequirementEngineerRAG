Software Requirements Specification
1.
Introduction
This document specifies requirements for a computerized automated diagnostic tool for the detection of
faults in certain heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system components.  The automated
diagnostic tool is being developed for Architectural Energy Corporation (AEC) by Battelle as part of a
program sponsored by the California Energy Commission (CEC).  Supplemental cost-share funds are
provided by U.S. Department of Energy through the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).
1.1
Purpose
This Requirements Specification (RS) specifies the essential capabilities required of the automated
diagnostic tool. The purpose of this document is to clarify for AEC, the California Energy Commission
(CEC), the Office of Buildings Programs, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERN) of
the U.S. Department of Energy, and the project team the results that must be achieved by the automated
diagnostic tool.  Any illustrative model presented in this document is used solely to explain the
requirements and is NOT intended to address design or implementation issues.
This SRS also specifies key AEC, CEC, and EERN requirements for project deliverables, including
documentation.
1.2
Scope
The automated diagnostic tool detects and identifies faults in chillers and cooling tower subsystems of
HVAC units using sensed data acquired from the unit, unit specifications, unit installation and
configuration data, and unit operation data (such as schedules).  The tool is a software product that will be
utilized primarily by building operators and facilities managers and only secondarily by HVAC service
technicians, energy service providers, and operation supervisors.  Building operators will use the tool to
monitor units for which they are responsible, perhaps monitoring from a central control room within the
building.  Service technicians will utilize the product on site during repair and maintenance visits or off site
between visits.  Energy service providers, responsible for a number of customers and facilities, will use the
product to monitor a number of units remotely, possibly in many different buildings, checking for
inefficiencies and problems requiring dispatch of service personnel.  Finally, building operator supervisors
will use the tool to guide decisions on the assignment of operators and prioritization of work.  The tool will
provide the user with a visual indication of faults, descriptive information concerning the faults and their
causes, and suggested corrective actions.  The tool will store the results of diagnostics for subsequent
retrieval and use.
The software require ments described in this document are applicable to HVAC systems and associated
subsystems.  Such subsystems can include chillers, cooling towers, and boilers.  However, the initial
version of the tool will focus on diagnostics for chillers and cooling towers only.    The tool will automate
diagnostic processes hitherto performed through a visual analysis of graphical data by a human expert.
The “Product Overview” section describes factors that affect the software and its requirements. The
“Concept Example” appendix describes how the software would function in an example situation.

Overall Description
The following overview of the automated diagnostic tool supplies context for the specific requirements
presented in later sections. The purpose of this information is to make the specific requirements easier to
understand. All specific requirements are numbered in later sections.
2.1
Product Perspective
Currently, diagnostics on HVAC units and subsystems are performed largely on a manual basis.  Sensed
data, e.g., temperatures and pressures, are obtained from one or more data acquisition devices.  These
devices measure and store sensed data over periods of several days to several weeks.  Prior to the
diagnostic process, data from these devices is input to graphical display software for visual inspection by a
human expert.  The expert, relying on technical expertise and results of previous diagnostic experience,
evaluates the condition of the unit and subsystems based on visual plots of the data.  This process is
depicted in Figure 1.

The process depicted in Figure 1 can be partitioned into three logical components.  These components are
delineated in the diagram by dashed lines and are the data-preprocessing component, the diagnostic
component, and output component.  The diagnostic tool described in this document will replace the current
process with an automated one based on algorithms derived from expert practices.  These algorithms
operate without the need for data visualization or human expert input.  Diagnostic results will be displayed
to the user and stored for subsequent retrieval and analysis.  For the purposes of this document, the
automated diagnostic tool will be assumed to preserve the logical construction of the current process.  This
construction is depicted in Figure 2.

2.2
Product Functions
As previously stated, the functionality of the automated diagnostic tool can be partitioned into three logical
components:  the data preprocessing component, the diagnostic component, and the output component.
The data-preprocessing component obtains data describing the subsystem under diagnosis and reduces,
filters, and otherwise prepares the data for input to the diagnostic component.  This data includes sensed
data, e.g., temperatures, pressures, electrical current, machine state, etc., as well as fixed data describing the
characteristics of the subsystem under diagnosis, for example, specifications and design information,
operating characteristics and set points, etc.  The data may be processed through averaging, trending, or
other statistical analysis.  Sensed data can originate from data acquisition hardware either in real time or at
some arbitrary time after acquisition.  Fixed data will generally be compiled prior to operation of the
diagnostic tool and be obtained from permanent storage when needed.  Specific requirements will be placed
on the data-preprocessing component only with respect to types of data to be input and the format and
interface requirements of this input.  However, the component is described here to provide insight into the
operation of the software.
The diagnostic component will detect and identify faults in the operation of HVAC subsystems based on
sensed and fixed data input from the data-preprocessing component.  The diagnostic algorithms used for
fault detection will be derived from current expert practices by AEC.  The faults identified by the

diagnostic will be enumerated and described under the functional requirements section.
The output component will display and record results output from the diagnostic component.  The results of
the diagnostics will be displayed to the user in a simple, graphical and textual format. The results will also
be stored to permanent storage for subsequent retrieval and analysis.
2.3
User and Environment Characteristics
As previously stated, users of the automated diagnostic tool will include service technicians, energy service
providers, building operators, and building operator supervisors.  Installed platforms could include portable
computers, handheld devices, and personal workstations in control rooms and offices.  Installed platforms
may communicate with the HVAC unit under diagnosis using wireless interfaces, direct point-to-point
connections, or over Internet or local area network.  Platform operating systems will be initially restricted
to Microsoft Windows-compatible systems.
The computer expertise of the user base could vary over a wide range.  Some users could be quite
sophisticated, others familiar with only the most rudimentary computer-based tasks.  However, it is
expected that all users will have a good fundamental understanding of HVAC units.  Setting up and
operating the automated diagnostic tool should require minimal user input.
Service technicians are expected to use the software as often as their service tasks dictate, perhaps several
times a day for periods up to about one hour, in close proximity to the HVAC unit and possibly out of
doors.   They may also set up the diagnostic tool to collect data continuously offsite at their offices and
inspect the data periodically to identify faults or confirm proper operation.  Building operators are expected
to use the software on an occasional basis every day.  The tool would collect data and process it
continuously but the operators would only check the results periodically.  They may view results for only a
few seconds to check the status of equipment while passing through a control room or may sit at a monitor
for several minutes more carefully inspecting the diagnostic results and other information available on the
tool’s display.  Energy service providers and building operator supervisors could potentially use the
software in a more continuous mode, allowing it to operate undisturbed for many hours or days to record
diagnostic results over a period of time.
See the “Concept Example” appendix for a detailed example of how the automated diagnostic tool will be
used.
2.4
General Constraints
The automated diagnostic tool must support a wide variety of users with respect to computer expertise.  In
addition, different users will have different expectations for the tool with respect to data presentation and
functionality.  For instance, some users will simply require an immediate diagnostic result while other users
may be interested in diagnostic results generated over an arbitrary time that can be subsequently reviewed.
The tool must provide a capability to manually input and edit “fixed” data, i.e., data that does not vary in
real-time.  Such data includes HVAC unit set points, specifications, and configuration information.  This
data must be stored for subsequent use by the diagnostic tool for review and verification by other users and
management.  The tool should provide for configuration management of fixed data.

Page 7
The user must have the capability to configure the tool for continuous diagnostic analysis over an indefinite
period of time.  In this mode, the tool will record diagnostic results for subsequent review.   No printed
reports will be required of the tool, but the tool must print screen images of diagnostic results and historical
data at user request and must provide long term storage of diagnostic results and permit the user to supply
metadata relevant to the results, e.g., location, HVAC serial number, model number, user name, date, etc.
The tool will not provide capability for additional user-defined analysis of the diagnostic results, results
will be provided in a simple, final, definitive manner.  However, the tool may provide the user the
capability to adjust the sensitivity of the diagnostic algorithms to increase the probability of exposing
typically undetected diagnostic events or concealing detected diagnostic events (including false detections).
The tool will be capable of obtaining sensed data from a variety of sources.  Such sources should include
real-time data acquisition devices and data files containing previously acquired data.
The current version of the tool will include diagnostic algorithms for cooling tower and chiller subsystems
of HVAC units.  However, the design of the software should support the incorporation of diagnostic
algorithms for additional HVAC subsystems.  In addition, the tool should support modification or
replacement of existing diagnostic algorithms.
The automated diagnostic tool will be restricted to Microsoft Windows-compatible operating systems.
2.5
Use -Case Model Survey
This section provides an overview of the use case model that describes the operation of the user interface.
Actual use cases that specifically define the operation of the user interface are presented in the
requirements section.
2.5.1 Introduction
The use case model consists of five use cases as depicted in Figure 3.  The main actor in the use case model
is the human user.  This actor is generalized as “User”.  The User can be further specified as a general user
or administrator.  The general user has no ability to modify system settings.  The admin istrator user is able
to modify certain settings.  The use case “Start and Stop Diagnostics” describes the process by which the
administrator user activates and ceases diagnostic processing.  The use case “Browse Current Diagnostics”
describes the process by which the user views current diagnostic results.  The use case “Browse Historical
Diagnostics” describes the process by which the user views historical diagnostic results.  The use case
“Configure Diagnostics” describes the process by which the administrator user adjusts diagnostic
parameters used in the diagnostic process.  The use case “Authenticate User” describes the process by
which the user makes known to the tool the privileges to which they are entitled.

Use -Case Specifications
This section describes the fi ve main use cases describing the functionality of the user interface.
These use cases are “Start and Stop Diagnostics”, “Browse Current Diagnostics”, “Browse
Historical Diagnostics”, “Configure Diagnostics”, and “Authenticate User”.  The use cases “Start
and Stop Diagnostics” and “Configure Diagnostics” include the use case “Authenticate User”.
3.1.1 Start and Stop Diagnostics Use Case
3.1.1.1 Brief Description
This use case provides the actor the means to start and stop diagnostic processing.  The actor in
this case is the administrator user (see 2.5.1).
3.1.1.2 Flow of Events
The use case begins just prior to when the user launches the application.
3.1.1.2.1
Basic Flow – Start Diagnostics
1. The user launches the tool by double-clicking the icon
associated with the tool or typing the application’s name.
2. The tool momentarily displays a splash screen
identifying the tool, identifying developing and
sponsoring organizations as appropriate, and listing
copyright information.
3. The tool displays the main window of the tool.
4. The user starts the diagnostic processing by selecting a
menu item named “Start Diagnostics” from a drop down
menu named “Status”.
5. Include (Authenticate User).  If the user has the
appropriate privilege (i.e., the user is the administrator
user) the tool requests a confirmatory response from the
user to start the diagnostic processing.
6. If the user confirms the desire to start diagnostic
processing, the tool starts the processing and displays

an animated indication that diagnostic processing is
active.
7. If the user responds negatively to the confirmation, the
tool does not start the diagnostic processing but the user
remains authenticated.
8. If the user does not have the appropriate privilege, the
tool does not start the diagnostic processing.
9. The user secures the tool by selecting a menu item
named “Logout” from the drop down menu named “File”.
10. The tool returns the current user’s privileges to those of
the general user.
11. If a period of 15 minutes elapses whereby the user does
not secure the tool, the users privileges will automatically
revert to those of a general user.
3.1.1.2.2
Alternative Flow
3.1.1.2.2.1
Stopping Diagnostic Processing
1. The user can stop diagnostic processing at any time
after the diagnostic processing has started by selecting
the “Stop Diagnostics” menu item from the main menu
entitled “Status”.
2. If the user is not authenticated as the administrator user,
include (Authenticate User) to validate privileges for
stopping diagnostic processing.
3. If the user has the appropriate privilege, the tool
requests confirmation to stop diagnostic processing.
4. If the user responds positively to the confirmation, the
tool stops diagnostic processing and indicates the
stopped condition.  Otherwise the software performs no
function but the user remains authenticated.
5. If the user selects the “Exit” menu item from the main

Functionality
This section describes the functional requirements of the software, that is, requirements
describing the core functions the software must perform.  This section begins with general
requirements relevant to the tool as a whole.  Subsequently, requirements are organized by the
logical construction of the tool as data processing progresses from preprocessing to output
processing.
3.2.1 General
The following general requirements pertain equally to the logical partitions of the tool.
3.2.1.1 Users of the tool shall be classified into two types.  The first type, general user, shall only be
permitted to utilize a limited set of the capabilities of the tool.  These capabilities are listed in Table 2.
Typically a general user is only permitted to view the results of diagnostic processing either current or
historical.  The second type, administrator, shall be permitted all the privileges of the general user plus
those identified in Table 2.  The administrator is permitted all the privileges of the general user in addition
to the privileges to configure the system and modify fixed data and diagnostic settings.

units
3.2.2 Preprocessing
The automated diagnostic tool shall input sensed data in real time from data acquisition devices
and the HVAC unit under diagnosis as well as from data files containing previously acquired data,
though not simultaneously.  In addition, the tool shall input fixed data provided by the user.
Sensed and fixed data used by the tool in performing automated diagnostics shall be stored to
permanent storage for post-analysis by the diagnostic process and viewing of the results.
3.2.2.1 The tool shall input sensed data in real time from data acquisition devices and the HVAC unit
under diagnosis.  The absolute time of input will be associated with each sensed data item for its
complete lifecycle, including permanent storage.  The time will be determined at the instant the
acquisition of the sensed data is complete.

Page 17
3.2.2.2 The tool shall permit sensed data to be input from an electronic file, though not simultaneously
with sensed data from external acquisition hardware.  When inputting sensed data from an electronic file,
only one file shall be used containing all necessary sensed data.  The file shall be an ASCII text file
containing only columns delimited by a single tab character or single comma.  The file shall begin with a
required header.  The first column of the header will list, at a minimum, the entries “”Building Identifier”
and “Input Identifier” in that order.  Following columns on the Input Identifier row will list integer input
identifiers.  Following columns on the Building Identifier row will list corresponding integer building
identifiers for the inputs.   One or more comment rows may exist above and below these required rows.
These comment rows are identified by a ‘#’ as the first character of the first column.  These rows are
ignored by the tool.  The first uncommented column in the file after the required headers shall list the
absolute time, in ascending order, associated with all entries in subsequent columns of the row.  Each
additional column in the file shall pertain to one and only one sensed parameter.  Data values in the same
row of the file correspond to identical time values.  All columns in the file shall have the same number of
rows.  An example input file is presented in Table 3.  When the tool is processing sensed data from an
input file, the tool is considered to be operating in “batch mode”.

3.2.2.3 Each sensed data item will be qualified as to its certitude during the acquisition process.  Sensed
data will be considered in doubt if acquisition of the data was not possible (for example, if an error occurs
during communication with the acquisition hardware), or the data is outside the range of possible values.
Otherwise, the sensor value will be deemed accurately acquired.
3.2.2.4 The software will deem sensed data in doubt if acquisition of the data is not possible, due to
communication failures, for a default number of successive samples.  The default is dependent on sensor
type.  These default values are specified in Table 4.  The number of successive samples for a given
sensor type shall be modifiable by the administrator.  Data not successfully acquired will be deemed
“missing data”.

The Sump temperature is
above the cooling tower fan
“on” set point, but all cooling
tower fans are not on.  This
indicates a problem with the
fan staging and, as a result,
the cooling tower is not
maintaining the sump
temperature as low as it
should.
Cooling Tower Fan Staging
Cooling Tower Fan Staging Problem
A fan is on even though the
sump temperature is below
the “off” set point.  This
indicates a fan staging
problem, and energy is being
wasted.  All cooling tower
fans should be off.
Cooling Tower Range
Cooling Tower Range Problem
The cooling tower range is
below its benchmark.  As
result, heat rejection by the
cooling tower is less than
expected and the cooling
tower is performing at less

Cooling Tower Fan Cycling
Problem
The cooling tower fan is
not staying on long
enough during cycling.
1)  The timer that is
supposed to
eliminate short
cycling is not
working properly.
2) The "on" and
"off" control set
points for the fan
are too close to one
another.  3) The
cooling tower
capacity is too great
for the load, so the
fans rapidly cycle
off (i.e., the on time
is very short)
because the load is
met quickly.
Cooling Tower
Sump Temperature is
Improperly Controlled
The cooling tower fan is
off but should be on.  As
a result, the condenser
water is not being cooled
sufficiently.
1) a cooling tower

The cooling tower fan is
on but it should be off.
Energy is being wasted.
1) a cooling tower
control problem, 2)
an actuator or relay
has failed.
Cooling Tower Approach
Problem
The cooling tower
approach is greater than
the Approach
Benchmark provided in
set up.  Heat rejection
from the cooling tower is
less than expected.
1) The cooling
tower media is
fouled due to
mineral deposits or
ambient dirt, dust,
or other
contaminants.
2) Restricted
airflow for other
reasons (e.g., piece
of cardboard stuck
over part of cooling
tower air inlet).  3)
There is condenser
pump fouling, pipe
fouling, or other
restrictions on the
water side.
The Sump temperature is
above the cooling tower
fan “on” set point, but all
cooling tower fans are
not on.  This indicates a
problem with the fan
staging and, as a result,
the cooling tower is not
maintaining the sump
temperature as low as it
should.
1)  Different values
of the fan “on” set
point are  specified
in the fan controller
and this software.
2) Fan staging
control algorithm is
not correctly
specified.  3)  A fan
motor or electrical
connection has
failed.  4)  The
sump temperature
sensor has failed or
is out of calibration.
Cooling Tower Fan Staging
Problem
A fan is on even though
the sump temperature is
below the “off” set
point.  This indicates a
fan staging problem,
and energy is being
wasted.  All cooling
tower fans should be
off.
1)  Different values
of the fan “off” set
point are  specified
in the fan controller
and this software.
2) Fan staging
control algorithm is
not correctly
specified.  3)  The

Cooling Tower Range
Problem
The cooling tower range
is below its benchmark.
As result, heat rejection
by the cooling tower is
less than expected and
the cooling tower is
performing at less than
its capacity.
1)  Tower media
may be fouled due
to mineral deposits
or ambient dirt,
dust, or other
contaminants.
2)  the airflow is
restricted by some
other obstruction.
3) The condenser
pump is fouling,
pipes are fouling, or
there are other
water-side flow
restrictions.  4)  The
cooling tower is too
small for the load
(i.e., there is a
design problem)
The is possibly a
problem with the supply
fan control.
The chilled water
pump is off and the
supply fan for at
least one air handler
served by this pump

3.5.1.25
The diagnostic history window shall provide user selections for start times and end times
for the history interval.  These selections shall be in the form of a calendar control.
3.5.1.26
The smallest time interval displayed by the diagnostic history window is one week.
3.5.1.27
The longest time interval that may be displayed by the diagnostic history window is two
years.
3.5.1.28
The color map of the history window shall indicate confirmed faults with the color red,
potential faults with the color yellow, normal conditions with the color green, and periods when diagnostic
processing was not active with the color gray.  Diagnostic processing should be assumed inactive
between periods of time when no confirmed fault, potential fault, or normal condition has been recorded.
3.5.1.29
The vertical axis of the color map of the history window shall indicate hour of the day and
the horizontal axis shall indicate the absolute date and the day of week.
3.5.1.30
The diagnostic history window shall have a button labeled “Print” that when clicked will
display a window listing items to print including the diagnostic information window, the history window,
and both the diagnostic and history windows.  The user selects the item of interest and clicks the “OK”
button to print the selection, an image(s) of the item(s) selected.
3.5.1.31
The diagnostic history window shall have a button labeled “Close” that will dismiss the
window.
3.5.1.32
The subsystems window, condition window, and diagnostic information window shall
display a title that indicates its specific location or absolute path in the navigation hierarchy of windows.
This title shall be a concatenation of the title of the previous window displayed, not including the
diagnostic history window, and the name of the entry selected to obtain the current window.  The two
parts of the title shall be separated by a dash surrounded by a single space.
3.5.1.33
The main window, subsystems window, condition window, and diagnostic information
window shall display the appropriate time below the title as specified in 3.3.1.3.
3.5.1.34
The main window, subsystems window, and condition window shall have three diagnostic
indicators for each item listed.
3.5.1.35
One indicator shall be active when no diagnostic conditions exists.  This indicator shall be
designated the “OK” indicator and shall appear green when active.
3.5.1.36
One indicator shall be active when a potential diagnostic condition exists.  This indicator
shall be designated the “Caution” and shall appear yellow when active.
3.5.1.37
One indicator shall be active when a confirmed diagnostic condition exists.  This indicator
shall be designated the “Not OK” indicator and shall appear red when active.
3.5.1.38
Only one indicator shall be active at a given time for a specific diagnostic and no
indicators shall flash when active.
3.5.1.39
The diagnostic indicators on the main window and subsystems window shall summarize
all diagnostic conditions associated with each entry in the window.  In general, an active “OK” indicator
indicates no positive diagnostic results currently exist within the building or subsystem, as applicable for
the window.  An active “Caution” indicator indicates that at least one potential problem currently exists
within the building or subsystem, as applicable, and no confirmed problem currently exists.  An active
“Not OK” indicator indicates at least one confirmed problem exists regardless of whether cautionary or

Security
Certain functions of the tool directly available to the user require the user to possess supplementary
privileges associated with performing these functions.  These supplementary privileges are possessed by
the administrator user and are in addition to those of the general user as described in 2.5.  The tool
determines the type of user by requesting an identifier and password from the user.  The requirements
related to this process are discussed in other requirements in this document.
3.7
Other Requirements
The tool shall log to permanent storage the occurrence of changes to the fixed data.  The log shall indicate
the time and date of the change, original value of the item(s) changed, and the new value of the item(s)
changed.

1.1.1  Evaluate Compressor Power
vs. Time
Compare the current time to the scheduled time for the chiller to be on.,
If the current time is a scheduled chiller "on" time, then stop--make no further check.  OK.
If the current time is outside the scheduled chiller "on" times (i.e., the chiller should be off),
then check if the Compressor Status = "Off."
If the Compressor Status = "Off," then the chiller is off as it should be and it is OK.
Set Chiller Schedule OK/Not = "OK".
If the Compressor Status = "On," then the Chiller is "On" when it should be off.  Not
OK.  Energy is being wasted.  Set Chiller Schedule OK/Not = "Not OK"
Note:  The purpose of this process is to determine if the chiller is on when it is supposed to be off.

Compare CHWSTFraction High with CHWST Alarm Trigger High.

Notes:  Conclusions regarding a fault existing or not based on individual points are likely to be
unrealiable.  Conclusions are likely to best be made by considering a high percentage of points over
some period of time exceeding some minimum time, e.g., a day or a week (24  hours or 168 hours).
Therefore, we base the assignment of CHWST Alarm on a minimum set of points rather than individual
points.

for which CHWST Maintained OK/not = "Too High".
Set Mean Too Low CHWST Deviation = null.
If CHWSTAlarm = Too Low, then
Calculate mean CHWST for the times correspoding to the too-low points in the CHWST

which CHWST Maintained OK/not = "Too Low".
Set Mean Too High CHWST Deviation = null.
Note:  This process is proposed for Round 2.  Also, additional or other statistics could be calculated in

1.3.1  Evaluate Compressor current (or power) vs time
If Compressor Status = "On" and  Last Compressor Status = "On",   then terminate this evaluation.  Nothing new to
check.
If Compressor Status = "On" and Last Compressor Status = "Off," then set Last Compressor Switch On Time = Current
Time and check Last Compressor Off Interval.
Calculate the Last Compressor Off Interval using
Last Compressor Off Interval = Last Compressor Switch On Time - Last Compressor Switch Off Time
If Last Compressor Off Interval  >= Minimum Compressor Off Time, then set Compressor Off Cycle OK/not =
"OK."
If Last Compressor Off Interval  <  Minimum Compressor Off Time, then set Compressor Off Cycle OK/not =
"not OK." The compressor is not staying off long enough during cycling.  Possible causes include an
incorrectly specified minimum off time in the control algorithm or for compressors with minimum on/off times
controlled by a relay a failed relay or one requiring adjustment.
If Compressor Status = "Off" and Last Compressor Status = "Off," then terminate this evaluation.  Nothing new to check.
If Compressor Status = "Off" and  Last Compressor Status =  "On",  then set Last Compressor Switch Off Time = Current
Time and check Last Compressor On Interval.
Calculate the Last Compressor On Interval using
Last Compressor On Interval = Last Compressor Switch Off Time - Last Compressor Switch On Time
If Last Compressor On Interval >= Minimum Compressor On Time, then Compressor On Cycle OK/not =
"OK."
If Last Compressor On Interval  <  Minimum Compressor On Time, then Compressor On Cycle OK/not =
"not OK." The compressor is not staying on long enough during cycling.  Possible causes include an
incorrectly specified minimum on time in the control algorithm or for compressors with minimum on/off times
controlled by a relay a failed relay or one requiring adjustment.
Update Last Compressor Status : Set Last Compressor Status = Compressor Status*

If Chiller Condenser Type = Air-Cooled, then terminate this analysis.

the Compressor Status = "Off" and  Last Compressor Status = "Off," and current Condenser

are cycling (turning on and off) unnecessarily and Compressor Interlock With Condenser

pumps."
If the Compressor Status = "On" and the Condenser-Pumps Status = "Off,"  then Compressor
Interlock With Condenser Pumps OK/not = "not OK."  The chiller cannot reject heat and this could
result in damage to the compressor.
If the Compressor Status = "Off" and the Condenser-Pumps Status = "On," then further evaluation is
required
.
If Current Time - Condenser Pumps Last Time Turned On <= Condenser Pumps Max Start-

this corresponds to no fault detected).
If Current Time - Condenser Pumps Last Time Turned On > CondenserPumps Max Start-Up

pumps are turning on too much in advance of the chiller and wasting energy.

Compare the CT Fans Status and Condenser Pumps Status for the current time.
If the CT Fans Status = "On" and the Condenser Pumps Status = "On," then CT Fans/Condenser
Pumps Interlock OK/Not = "OK"
If the CT Fans Status = "Off" and the Condenser Pumps Status = "Off," then CT Fans/Condenser
Pumps Interlock OK/Not = "OK."
If the CT Fans Status = "On" and the Condenser Pumps Status = "Off,"  then CT Fans/Condenser
Pumps Interlock OK/Not = "Not OK."  The CT Fans must be off when the condenser pumps are off,
otherwise energy is being wasted.
If the CT Fans Status = "Off" and the Condenser Pumps Status = "On," then CT Fans/Condenser
Pumps Interlock OK/Not = "OK." The cooling tower Fans may be off when  the  condenser pumps are
running, but this should not always be the case.
Note:  This process uses as inputs the CT Fans Status and the Condenser Pumps Status that are determined in
Process 7.0.
Values of CT Fans/Condenser Pumps Interlock OK/Not = "OK" should be interpretted more precisely as "no
problem has been detected with this interlock."  It is possible that no problem is detected under current
conditions,yet an interlock problem exists.  This is particularly true when CT Fans Status = "Off" and Condenser
Pumps Status = "On,"  which while OK under some condtions is not always OK.  Additional diagnostics would be
useful here.

Determine if new cycling information is available to analyze (fans currently on).
If CT Fans Status = "On" and Last CT Fans Status = "On,"  then terminate this evaluation.  There is nothing new to check.
If CT Fans Status = "On" and Last CT Fans Status = "Off," then set Last CT Fans On Time = Current Time and check Last CT Fans Off

If Last CT Fans Off Interval  >= Minimum CT Fans Off Time, then CT Cycling OK/Not  = "OK."
If Last CT Fans Off Interval  <  Minimum CT Fans Off Time, then CT Cycling OK/Not =  "Not OK." The CT fans are not staying off
long enough during cycling.
Possible causes include::
The timer that is supposed to eliminate short cycling is not working properly.
The "on" and "off" control setpoints for the fans are too close to one another.
Possible corrective actions include:
Check the control algorithm for the fans if it is controlled by software.  Increase the minimum off time in the
software, as necessary, to meet the manufacturers specification for minimum off time.
Check the performance of the time-delay relay.  Energize the relay and manually time the delay until action.
Compare the measured time with the specification.  Replace or adjust the relay if it is out of spec.

Possible causes include:
The timer that is supposed to eliminate short cycling is not working properly.
The "on" and "off" control setpoints for the fans are too close to one another.
The cooling tower capacity is too great for the load, so the fans rapidly cycle off (i.e., the on time is very short)
because the load is met quickly.
Possible corrective actions include:
Check the control algorithm for the fans if it is controlled by software.  Increase the minimum off time in the
software, as necessary, to meet the manufacturers specification for minimum off time.
Check the performance of the time-delay relay.  Energize the relay and manually time the delay until action.

Compare values of CT Approach to the CT Approach Benchmark.
If CT Approach is <= CT Approach Benchmark,  then set CT Approach OK/Not = "OK"
If CT Approach is > CT Approach Benchmark, then there is a problem (not OK) with CT heat rejection.  Set CT
Approach OK/Not = "Not OK.  There is a problem with heat rejection from the cooling tower."
Possible causes of heat rejection degradation (i.e., CT Approach OK/Not = Not OK):
Cooling tower media fouled due to mineral deposits or ambient dirt/dust/etc.  Need to inpsect.
Restricted airflow for other reasons (e.g., piece of cardboard stuck over part of cooling tower air
inlet)
Condenser pump fouling, pipe fouling, or other restrictions on the water side.

3.1.1  Set Compressor "On" Threshold
Calculate the Compressor "On" Threshold using
Compressor "On" Threshold = Compressor P x Compressor Motor Rated Current (or Power)
Notes:
The chiller is "on" when the compressor is "on;"  therefore, the chiller status can be determined by
evaluating the compressor on/off status.  As the result, the Chiller "On" Threshold is set by setting the
Compressor "On" threshold.
The Compressor "On" Threshold is calculated from input power rating of the compressor motor.
Compressor P has values that range from 10 to 50% --  this can be a user input.

3.1.2  Assess Compressor Status and State
For each  value of Compressor Current (or Power),
compare Compressor Current (or Power) to the Compressor "On" Threshold.
If the value of Compressor Current (or Power) <= Compressor "On" Threshold, then set Compressor
Status = "Off" and set Compressor State = "Off"
If the value of Compressor Current (or Power) > Compressor "On" Threshold, then set Compressor

If Compressor Status = "On", then evaluate Compressor State as follows:
Update the value of Last Compressor State,  using
Last Compressor State = Compressor State.
Determine and assign the new value of Compressor State for the current  time
Check if the compressor is already in steady state
If Last Compressor State = Steady,
then set Compressor State = "Steady"
If Compressor Status = "On" and the Last Compressor State = "Transient",  then
Calculate Drop in CHW Supply Temperature using
Drop in CHWST = CHWST Last - CHWST
Compare Drop in CHW Supply Temperature to the Minimum Transient Decrease in CHWST.
If Drop in CHWST >  Minimum Transient Decrease in CHWST, then set Compressor
State =  "Transient".
If Drop in CHWST <= Minimum Transient Decrease in CHWST, then set Compressor

Calculate the Minimum Transient Decrease in CHWST using the relation:
Minimum Transient Decrease in CHWST = CHW Transient Decrease Factor * (CHWST at
Last Time Off - CHWST Setpoint)
Set new value of CHWST at Last Time Off,
If Compressor Status = "Off" and  Last Compressor Status = "Off",  then
set CHWST at Last Time Off = CHWST
If Compressor Status = "On" and Last Compressor Status = "Off", then
set CHWST at Last Time Off = CHWST Last
If Compressor Status = "On" and Last Compressor Status = "On" then
set CHWST at Last Time Off = CHWST at Last Off Time (i.e., not change).
Update Last Compressor Status
Last Compressor Status = Compressor Status*
*This over-writes the previous compressor status with the current status and should not be performed if
the previous status is required in subsequent processing.

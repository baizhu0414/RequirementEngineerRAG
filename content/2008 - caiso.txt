1. Overview
Following the complete or major loss of system generation (blackout), it will be
necessary to establish initial generation that can supply a source of electric power to
other system generation and begin system restoration.  These initiating generators are
referred to as system Black Start generators.  They must be able to self-start without
any source of off-site electric power and maintain adequate voltage and frequency
while energizing isolated transmission facilities and auxiliary loads of other
generators. Generators that can safely reject load down to their auxiliary load are
another form of Black Start generator that can aid system restoration, but are not
addressed with this Black Start Capability Plan (BCP).
From a planning perspective, a system Black Start Capability Plan (BCP) is necessary
to ensure that the quantity and location of system Black Start generators are sufficient
and that they can perform their expected functions as specified in overall coordinated
WECC BCP.
The CAISO may from time to time test Unit(s) designated to provide Black Start
service (through an RMR or Interim Black Start Contract) by requiring the Unit to
deliver Black Start service pursuant to a Test Dispatch Notice provided to Owner’s
Scheduling Coordinator using the procedures described in the Tariff Sections 4.2 and
4.3.  Such Test Dispatch Notice shall be marked “Black Start Test Notice.”  The Black
Start Test shall be performed in accordance with the Ancillary Services Requirements
Protocol in the CAISO Tariff.  The CAISO shall not request a Black Start Test for a
hydroelectric Unit during periods of constrained water availability.

2. Grid Planning
The following provides general guidance for CAISO Black Start planning:
Step
Description
1
The CAISO determines the amount and location of Black Start Generation
it requires through contingency studies that are used as the basis of the
CAISO’s emergency plans. The studies specify:
• The initiating disturbance,
• The magnitude of the Outage, including the extent of the Outage (local
area, CAISO Controlled Grid, or WECC),
• The assumed status of Generation after the initiating disturbance,
• The status of interconnections,
• The system Demand level at the time of the disturbance,
• The interconnection support, and assumptions regarding the availability
of support from other utilities to help restore Generation and Demand
• The generator performance including a percentage of Black Start units
(to be determined by the CAISO) which are expected to fail to start,
• Expected transmission system damage.
2
The CAISO annually verifies that the number, size, availability, and
location of system Black Start generating units are sufficient to meet
WECC restoration plan requirements for the CAISO Balancing Authority
Area.
3
The CAISO documents the Cranking Paths, including initial switching
requirements, between each Black Start generating unit and the units to be
started and provides this documentation for review to WECC upon
request. Such documentation may include Cranking Path diagrams.
4
The CAISO Black Start planning evaluation process includes the
following:
• Diverse fuel resources for Black Start power for generating units,
• Available cranking and transmission paths,
• Communication adequacy,
• Unit capability of maintaining adequate regulation of voltage and
frequency,
• Generator protection and control systems during the abnormal
conditions that will exist during system restoration,
• Limited energy resources (e.g., hydro, pumped storage hydro,
compressed air) are selected sparingly.
5
The planning evaluation process is coordinated, as appropriate, with the
Black Start capability plans of transmission owners and neighboring
Balancing Authorities.
6
The CAISO annually enters into RMR and Interim Black Start Contracts
with generators that satisfy the results of the annual planning evaluation
process.

the unit can perform its intended functions as required by the WECC BCP
(if any) and of this testing section.
• Submit documentation of the test results and analysis to the CAISO,
WECC, or NERC upon any request.
• Submit any past reports for Black Start tests with the CAISO and WECC.
o Those Participants who do not currently test their Black Start capability,
will be required to test their Black Start capability.
• Within 24 hours of conducting a Black Start test, all Participants will notify
the CAISO RT Dispatcher by phone indicating the success or failure of the
test.
• Within 14 days of performing a Black Start test, all Participants will file a
letter with the CAISO regarding the success or failure of the test.
2
Testing records shall include the dates of the tests, the duration of the tests,
and an indication of whether the tests met the requirements of this Black Start
Testing section.
3
The Black Start unit must have the ability to maintain voltage within
emergency voltage limits over a range of loading from no external load to full
external load in accordance with NERC reliability standards.
4
The Black Start unit must be equipped with governors that are capable of
operating in an isochronous mode.

Start process,
• Hot, steam-driven turbines, within 2.5 hours of the initiation of the Black
Start process.
• If the certified Black Start facility is in another reliability coordinator area
or is comprised of an unspecified technology then specific start time
limits are negotiated.
These times include ICU start-up, normal start-up of the unit, plus switching
time for the actual synchronizing of the unit.
9
The minimum run time duration (the generation time after being
synchronized to the grid) of a Black Start test is 10 minutes.

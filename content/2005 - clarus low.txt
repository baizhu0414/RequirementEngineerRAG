1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this requirements specification is to provide a repository for the
high-level and detailed requirements governing the design of the Clarus system.
These requirements capture the expression of general needs in the Clarus Concept
of Operations (ConOps), in meetings with potential users and participants, and in
subsequent documents identified below. These requirements will form the basis
for the design verification and validation of the system. The intended audience for
this document includes decision makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers.
This document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system
requirements, including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system.
As indicated in the highlighted box in Figure 1, the Detailed Systems
Requirements Specification (DRS) is an intermediate deliverable in the larger
context of the Clarus Weather System Design project, using criteria documented
in the Concept of Operations, High-Level Requirements Specification, Survey of
Environmental Sensor Stations, Analysis of COTS Systems, Analysis
Architectural Alternatives Analysis, and the Design Gaps Analysis as input to the
DRS.

1.2 Scope
Clarus is an initiative sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S.
DOT) to organize and make more effective environmental and road condition
observation capabilities in support of four primary motivations.
1) Provide a North American resource to collect, quality check, and make
available surface transportation weather and road condition observations
so that State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and other
transportation agencies can be more productive in maintaining safety and
mobility on all roads and surface transportation platforms. In addition to
increasing productivity, it will maximize their RWIS/ESS investments.
2) Surface transportation-based weather observations will enhance and
extend the existing weather data sources that support general purpose
weather forecasting for the protection of life and property.
3) Collection of real-time surface transportation-based weather observations
will support real-time operational responses to weather.
4) Surface transportation-based weather observations integrated with existing
observation data will permit broader support for the enhancement and
creation of models that make better predictions in the atmospheric
boundary layer and near the earth’s surface to support more accurate
forecasts.
The intent of the Clarus Initiative is to demonstrate how an open and integrated
approach to observational data management can be used to collect, control the
quality of, and consolidate surface transportation environmental data. The Clarus
Initiative will address the necessary infrastructure to consolidate the data from a
multitude of independent data collection systems. This process offers the prospect
of enhancing data coverage, improving the performance of meteorological support
services, and providing guidance to owners of these data sources regarding the
quality of their data and performance of their data collection systems.
Clarus represents the next step in bringing together surface transportation best
practices and the greater weather community. Surface transportation
environmental data collected by the Clarus system will include atmospheric data,
pavement data1, and hydrologic (water level) data.
The Clarus Initiative consists of two development components.
• The first component is the development of the Clarus system – a network
for sharing, quality checking, and exchanging surface environmental data
and relevant surface transportation conditions.
• The second component is the development of tools (such as decision
support systems) that make effective use of the Clarus system.
1 “Pavement data” in this context includes surface and subsurface data specified in NTCIP 1204 (Ref. 8).

The addition of Clarus system data to national weather observations will further
enhance general purpose weather forecasting, providing a wider range of benefits
to the protection of life and property.
Data from the Clarus system will have a wide variety of direct and indirect uses.
Users having the most immediate contact with the Clarus system will include the
owners and operators of the observing systems that are providing information to
the Clarus system, as well as the users directly accessing the data contained
within the Clarus system. The following is an initial list — which will likely grow
as the initiative progresses — of these stakeholders:
• Observation system owners including federal, state, local, and private
institutions;
• Instrument and observation platform suppliers;
• Direct data users including system owners and their contractors;
• Surface transportation weather service providers (which may include the
observation system owners – e.g., state DOTs);
• The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA);
• General weather service providers;
• Research and engineering community; and
• Climate data warehouse and other non-surface weather interests.
The deployed Clarus system is envisioned to include:
• A one-stop Internet portal for all surface transportation environmental
observations;
• Data provided with and without post-processing, ready to be incorporated
into value-added products including weather and traffic models as well as
decision support systems;
• Continuous quality checking of data with feedback to operators of the
originating sensor stations;
• Data transferred in one common protocol with full metadata;
• Management of users’ rights to input or extract specific data components;
• Data retrieval tools; and
• Support for the inclusion of new technologies such as vehicle-based
sensors, surface visibility information from traffic cameras, and remote
sensing technologies.

Some portions of the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref. 12) have been
incorporated in this document, both for continuity of concept, and to help identify
the basis for the high-level and detailed requirements. Specific attributions of this
content are only included where they enhance the context of the requirements.
1.5 Overview
The organization and content of this document is generally based on the IEEE
standards for System Requirements Specifications (Ref. 13). The requirements
presented in this document represent the high-level and detailed objectives,
constraints, and desires for the Clarus system.
Each requirement is identified by a unique Clarus-specific identifier to allow the
requirement to be referenced in future documents, providing traceability
throughout the development process. Each detailed requirement is traced to its
parent through its identification number followed by a unique identifier.
A requirements document states what must be accomplished to fulfill the vision
described in a concept of operations. It does not state how it is to be
accomplished. This document describes each requirement and the basis for
inclusion of that requirement.
The remaining sections of the document contain the requirements for the system.
The sections and their content are as follows:
Section 2 – General Description provides a general overview of the
entire system. This section describes the general factors that affect the
system and its requirements.
Section 3 – System Architecture provides an overview of the Clarus
system’s components and their functions. Specific requirements in the
next section are allocated to and organized according to these components.
Section 4 – Specific Requirements contains the requirements developed
from reference documentation and stakeholder communications. This
section organizes the requirements into categories that facilitate the system

2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
This section provides an overview of the entire system and describes the general
factors that affect the system and its requirements. This section does not state
specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to
understand by giving them context. That context and the overall intent of the
Clarus program are described in detail in the Clarus Concept of Operations (Ref.
12), from which much of the description in this section was derived.
2.1 System Perspective
The Clarus Initiative is essentially a plan to create a “network of networks” —
much like the Internet — for surface transportation environmental data. While the
Internet is an interconnection of computer networks, Clarus will be an
interconnection of environmental (weather, pavement, and water level condition)
data collection networks. Each of the weather networks will function
autonomously; they will collect information and disseminate it internally without
direction or dependence on Clarus.
Each participating weather network’s connection to Clarus will add two new
possible modes of functionality. First, the participants will be able to share
collected environmental data with Clarus. Second, participants will be able to
receive environmental data collected by Clarus. The primary recipients of this
data will be weather service providers, but any Clarus participants would be able
to receive data if they so chose. This concept of autonomous data sharing is
comparable to the World Wide Web layer of the Internet, where organizations can
publish information on web pages, or browse and download information
published by other organizations on the web. Ownership of the data is retained by
the organization that provided the data to Clarus, and the provider organization
can restrict the dissemination of the data through data sharing agreements with the
Clarus program.
The Clarus system will add a third mode of functionality, which might be called
“meta-librarian.” The Clarus system will collect, organize, and quality check the
environmental data to be published by the system. The data will be collected from
the participants, organized by location and type of data, and quality flags will be
added. When this is done, the data will be published to the Service Providers and
other participant/consumers in Clarus. Figure 2 shows the general process as data
progresses from collection through publication to service providers.

Figure 2 – Clarus Data Acquisition, Processing, and Publication
The principal interfaces that will be critical to Clarus are the interface between
Clarus and the participating collectors, and the interface between Clarus and the
participating service providers. MADIS, for example, uses NetCDF files as a
standard interchange format. While the service provider interface is completely
within the control of the Clarus Initiative, the interface(s) to the collectors may be
influenced by what interfaces these systems can support.
While the participants may want to access the network through “a one-stop
Internet portal for all surface transportation weather and pavement related
observations” (Ref. 12), there is no requirement that the system be a single
centralized system. Designers are free to explore centralized and de-centralized
architectures so long as the interfaces with participants give the appearance of a
“one-stop” portal.
The issues of data retention and archive are also not explicitly addressed. While
some data retention is likely to be necessary to support the quality checking
function and the publication function, there is a clear recognition that as the data
age, they lose value to all but climatological investigators and other researchers.
This phase of development does not include directly archiving the large volume of
environmental data in Clarus. Considering the technical scope of such an effort,
archiving may be externalized or be deferred until the Clarus network is
operational and proven.

2.2 System Functions
The Clarus system will collect data from contributing members, organize and
quality check the data, and then publish the data for use by service providers and
other members of the network. These basic processes are shown in Figure 3 in
terms of Clarus system objects and their interactions. The ellipses represent
specific types of data, user roles, or equipment, and the arrows represent the
interactions between them2. For example, a “Collector” administers a “Sensor,”
collects “Observation Data,” provides “Sensor Metadata,” and receives “Quality
Feedback”.
2 The arrows in Figure 3 do not indicate data flows; they show the subject-object orientation of the
relationship.

The volume of data involved in this process has the potential to become very
large, which leads to a significant challenge in developing a system that can
effectively gather, organize, quality check, and disseminate the data. The Clarus
system should be a data collection system capable of handling a vast range of data
in a flexible manner that permits new data types to be added.
Determining data types will be a significant challenge. Proper understanding of
the available data versus the required information will dictate how the data
gathering processes and the database itself should be designed for greatest
efficiency.
While there are many types of environmental data that could be collected, the
Clarus emphasis on surface weather and transportation puts the focus on those
weather elements that have a direct bearing on surface transportation systems.
These environmental data elements are described in the NTCIP 1204 standard for
Environmental Sensor Station (ESS) interfaces (Ref. 8) and summarized in Table
1 as potential environmental data elements to include in the Clarus system.

There are basic temporal limits for the data collection, quality checking,
processing, and publication of the environmental data. There is also a period for
which the Service Provider Customers have temporal-driven requirements. The
design of Clarus will need to consider these time horizons when planning the
technical limitations of the system architecture. These data time horizons are
illustrated in Figure 4.

Figure 4 – Time Horizons for Weather Data
The average elapsed time for the Autonomous Layer varies as a result of
configuration and communications latencies that are inherent within the operation
of the system to collect the data. The Clarus component includes the time
required to communicate data from the Autonomous Layer to the Clarus system
import process as well as the time required to process the input data into storage
structures. Further, the variation in the Service Provider component includes the
time required to add other data to the Clarus data and to perform the human- and
machine-based product generation. The average data age grows as a result of the
aggregated times required to move through the various layers and eventually to
the Service Provider Customers. The Clarus system design must address how best
to minimize these times to optimize the flow of data in a timely manner.
For the purposes of defining the boundaries of these time horizons, the following
definitions apply:
• Average Elapsed Time is the estimated time for the process within a
given layer or layer subdivision to take place. The age of observed and
recorded values can vary widely within these bands.
• Average Data Age is the estimated average age of an ESS observation as
it is transferred from the ESS to the end user.

2.3 User Characteristics
Direct and indirect use of the Clarus system can be applied to a wide audience.
Because a variety of users can derive benefit from the Clarus system, it is
necessary to focus upon those users who have the most immediate contact with
the system components.
The primary user classes include the owners and operators of the observing
systems collecting and sending information to Clarus, and the users directly
accessing the data published by the Clarus system.
The following is an initial list of stakeholders whose user needs are considered:
• Observation system owners including federal, state, local, and private
institutions;
• Instrument and observation platform suppliers;
• Direct data users including system owners and their contractors;
• Surface transportation weather service providers (which may include the
observation system owners);
• NOAA;
• General weather service providers;
• Research and engineering community; and
• Climate data warehouse and other non-surface weather interests.
This list of direct users of data from the Clarus system is a subset of the entire
population of stakeholders interested in the Clarus Initiative. The requirements of
the broader stakeholder community are essential to the Clarus Initiative and these
interests must serve as a framework for the core Clarus system. From information
in the Surface Transportation Weather Decision Support Requirements
(STWDSR) (Ref. 5), Weather Information for Surface Transportation (WIST)
(Ref. 6), and 511 Deployment Coalition (Ref. 7) documents, it is possible to
separate stakeholder groups into a condensed list based upon the user’s interface
or interaction with Clarus data.
The users are viewed as defining layers in the process of transferring data from
raw field observations to various levels of data use. This is illustrated in Figure 5.

Figure 5 – Clarus User Layers and Time Horizon Relationships
The Autonomous Layer is comprised of operational entities who utilize weather
and transportation data to make plans, decisions, and/or take action based upon
sensor data within their control. These data include observations collected by
ESS, mobile data acquisition platforms, cameras, and other transportation-related
measurement devices. The Autonomous Layer data comprises the vast majority of
the raw input data to the Clarus system.
The Clarus Layer lies between the Autonomous and Service Providers Layers
and represents the nationwide system and architecture to accomplish the
previously outlined goals of surface transportation environmental data collection
and management.
The Service Providers Layer is composed of both public and private entities that
provide basic and value-added weather support services to support the weather
information needs of the broader surface transportation community. These support
services rely on Clarus data (raw and processed) combined with other

environmental, road condition, or traffic information products to develop or
provide road weather information and enhanced products.
The Service Provider Customer Layer includes those groups who are direct
consumers of products generated by Service Providers and are generally not a
direct user of Clarus data. The members of this group could be anyone using
weather information, but are largely found within the surface transportation
community. The weather products received by these end users are built from a
combination of Clarus and non-Clarus data. In some instances, the Service
Provider Customer Layer includes entities and agencies also found within the
Autonomous Layer who receive quality checking information on the data they
originally provided to Clarus.
Figure 5 can also be viewed as a depiction of the time horizons that separate the
stakeholder groups. There is an inherent time scale, similar to Figure 4, emanating
from the center of the diagram outward, representing the flow and processing of
data through the Clarus system and between the layers.
The context diagram in Figure 6 illustrates the relationship of the entities
interfacing with Clarus. The diagram also describes the flow of data between the
entities and the Clarus system. The data provider organizations maintain data
collection systems. These organizations make up the Autonomous Layer — the
primary contributors of surface transportation data to the Clarus system. These
stakeholders can benefit from Clarus by receiving quality-controlled data from
the Clarus system. The quality-controlled data are not value-added data, but data
with flags indicating that elements do not meet quality checking thresholds.

The private and public sector Service Providers are the principal Clarus users.
These Service Providers generate value-added road and rail weather information
services for the transportation community. Additional Service Providers having
direct access to Clarus data resources include research organizations, external
agencies that may choose to archive Clarus data, and other related weather
service providers.
Within the context of Figure 6, the following roles can be assigned to each group
of users:
• Federal, State, and Local Agencies – These are the transportation system
and road weather information system (RWIS) operators and owners who
directly provide the Clarus data. This group places considerable emphasis
on the pavement-specific component of the data at the observational level
to make immediate decisions. These users, primarily maintenance and
operations personnel, are the principal consumers of information provided
by surface transportation weather service providers. Additional data from
this group may include closed circuit television (CCTV) images, road
condition information, and records of treatment activities such as plowing
and chemical application.
• Transit – These are the owners and operators of transit systems who
contribute raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-
controlled data from it. This group places considerable emphasis on
understanding weather conditions along designated routes.
• Rail – These are the owners and operators of rail systems who contribute
raw data to the Clarus system and may receive quality-controlled data
from it. This group places considerable emphasis on understanding
weather conditions along designated routes plus weather-induced specifics
such as rail temperatures, frozen switches, icing on electrical power
distribution systems, and drifting snow.
• Vehicle – Emerging technologies are developing that will encourage a
greater level of data collection from vehicles for the purpose of
understanding the nature of the transportation system state including the
impacts of weather. As this method of data collection matures, the
information obtained on weather and pavement conditions from
instrumentation on-board vehicles will be important Clarus data.
• Surface Transportation Weather Service Providers (STWSP) – These
surface transportation weather service providers are the private and public
weather service providers who assimilate the Clarus data with other
available data to generate value-added products and services used by the
surface transportation decision-makers at state and local transportation
agencies.
• Weather Service Providers – These include the weather support services
that are primarily interested in the meteorological and hydrologic
components of the Clarus data. This group includes the efforts in public
forecasting by NOAA and the National Weather Service (NWS) along
Clarus Weather System Design

with private sector weather services and their value-added support to
markets such as agriculture, power utilities, and construction.
• Research – This category incorporates federal, academic, and private
sector researchers who are working to improve the state of knowledge and
practice through the research of surface transportation weather.
• Archives – This category includes operational and non-operational
interests who choose to include the Clarus data in their endeavors. The
archiving of Clarus data will be most effective when combined with other
meteorological archives beyond the scope of Clarus, but is not restricted
to such efforts.
2.4 General Constraints
Timeliness of information and reliability of the system are major constraints on
the design. Both of these factors can be addressed through appropriate system
architecture and implementation.
To address the timeliness factor, the system should be designed such that it can
both retrieve and disseminate large volumes of data from a variety of sources and
at potentially high rates. An architecture that spreads its data collection and
dissemination processes across multiple servers and communication channels may
address this issue. The inherent scalability of such a design may also enable the
system to expand and add new data sources and end-users.
Reliability can be achieved through a variety of design and deployment
considerations. Hardware, operating system, and development environment have
significant impacts on the inherent reliability of the system. To maximize system
uptime, redundancies may be required at both the hardware and software levels of
the system. The primary challenge here will be the trade-off between the desire
for reliability and the cost of redundancies.
While the availability of the system is covered in the Concept of Operations, the
criticality of the system is not explicitly addressed. Since Clarus is not replacing
any existing application, the system is not currently critical to any operation or
transportation function; neither is it intended to support any “critical national
security missions.”3 Nonetheless, once the Clarus system is operational, many
DOTs will use the environmental data from the Clarus system in their normal
management and operations of their infrastructure. If the Clarus system fails,
requestors will need to use their legacy systems.
The system will be “open,” using architecture and communications interfaces that
are non-proprietary and broadly supported within the information technology
industry. The system should be standards based, where national standards are
applicable. Special consideration should be given to the national intelligent
transportation system (ITS) standards.
3 Security considerations for the Clarus system fall under the guidance of Reference 14, OMB Circular No.
A-130, which, by its own definition, does not apply to “critical national security missions.” Future
applications of Clarus may necessitate revisiting this classification.

2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
The usefulness of the Clarus system is dependent on participation by multiple
environmental data providers and multiple environmental data consumers. While
the system could be placed in operation with data from only a single contributing
network, there is no added value without the participation of other weather data
sources. Likewise, participation by a small number of data consumers would not
justify the cost of operating the system.
Several assumptions have been made as to how long it will take environmental
data contributors to collect, process, and publish their data. Data not collected in a
timely manner may be of limited use to the data consumers. Assumptions have
also been made about the accuracy of the data, and the ability of the contributing
systems to provide adequate location, time/date, and data qualification tags.
Accepting data from contributors who cannot provide these tags with the data
could seriously complicate the design of the data acquisition interfaces.
Even though the system will check the data and apply quality flags, consumers of
Clarus-provided data will need to understand that neither FHWA nor the
contributing data providers will accept responsibility for the accuracy of any of
the data. The particular limitations and conditions will be defined in data sharing
agreements to be established with data providers, and disclaimer information will
be made available to data consumers by whatever means the data are published.
Several requirements deal with “regional” needs, without specifying regional
boundaries. It is unlikely that the regional boundaries from contributing systems
will correspond with the regional boundaries defined within data consumer
systems. It is even likely that participating data contributors will have different
(though possibly overlapping) coverage areas for their networks. Data consumers
will need to understand that data will be presented by geographic coordinates, not
by regional boundaries. Consumers will also need to understand that coverage
will not be uniform and will depend on sensor placement by the contributing
organizations.
The availability, format, and precision of geo-reference coordinates for data
collection points could present unusual problems for the data acquisition system.
Data in the system database and in published data sets will likely include geo-
reference coordinates in decimal longitude, latitude, and elevation.
The availability, format, and precision of time/date stamps could also present
unusual problems for the data acquisition system, particularly if contributing
systems cannot manage Daylight Savings Time (DST), span time zones, or span
areas that do and do not participate in DST. Clarus timestamps for data in the
database and in published data sets need to be referenced to a standard time
reference such as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
The base assumption regarding “database tools” is that the selected data storage
software will include appropriate programming interfaces, query tools, and
configuration and management tools. No special database tools will be developed
as a part of the Clarus system. Some tools may developed in the future as part of
ongoing Clarus Initiative activities.

3 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The process of generating detailed system requirements has two major parts:
allocating the high-level requirements to specific system components, and
elaborating the requirements on the function and interchange between those
components. The functional components of the Clarus system have been detailed
in the Clarus System Architectural Description and are summarized in this
section. Figure 7, taken from that document, represents the general structure and
flow of information within the Clarus system.

Figure 7 – Data Flows within the Clarus System
Four of the components in Figure 7 are modeled as sets of services: the collector,
quality checking (QCh), qualified environmental data, and environmental
metadata services. The collector, QED, and EM services are sets of services
because each individual service represents a particular data format interface. A set
of services is required to properly interpret and transform all the incoming and
outgoing environmental information. The particular collector, QED, or EM
service performing a transformation depends on the origin and destination of the
environmental data.
The fourth component modeled as a set is the quality checking service. It is a set
of services because it represents in one component all the QCh algorithms that
can be applied to environmental data collected by Clarus. The specific algorithms
and sequence in which they are applied are determined by quality rules
established through the configuration & administration service. This arrangement
supports flexibility in adding and removing QCh algorithms to produce the best
possible qualified environmental data in the Clarus system.

There are two services that keep the Clarus system operating: the watchdog and
schedule services. The watchdog service monitors the overall system state and
restarts unresponsive services as needed, thus preventing long-term service
disruption. The schedule service prioritizes requests to receive environmental data
from collectors and contributors. The schedule service will also prioritize and
respond to subscription requests for environmental data (not depicted in Figure
7).
The set of collector services in the Clarus system receives environmental data
from ED collectors and contributors through both push and pull methods. Each
collector service is capable of understanding a particular data format and is
responsible for extracting the environmental data and placing it into the qualified
environmental data cache flagged as unqualified environmental data.
Quality rules set up by the configuration & administration service are executed by
the quality checking services to apply sets of computations on the environmental
data stored in the qualified environmental data cache. Flagging out-of-range
values is one example of a quality rule. Other quality rules could be created to
derive environmental conditions from existing information such as dew point.
Multiple passes by the quality checking services on the QEDC information could
apply grid algorithms sequentially to further quality check the environmental data.
This allows constant access to qualified environmental data in-process. The
QEDC is still valuable to end-users since it will always identify its level of quality
and can be continuously delivered.
The QED services format the qualified environmental data to fulfill requests from
and information subscriptions for environmental service providers and end-users.
Similarly, the EM services format the metadata to meet requests from and
metadata subscriptions for environmental service providers. Each of these
components is a set of services, with each individual service supporting a
particular data format.
The configuration and administration service supports both the Clarus system and
program. It maintains information about data provider redistribution restrictions
and controls who has access to modify the system state, quality rules, and set ED
retrieval schedules. The configuration & administration service manages environ-
mental metadata, formatting it for internal storage. Data transactions and system
operational statistics are logged in the configuration and administration user
interface as well. The configuration and administration user interface allows
administrative users to interact with these functions and supports the manual
quality review processes.

4 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
This section presents the high-level and detailed requirements for the Clarus
system and the associated institutional program necessary to achieve the needs
and goals described by the Concept of Operations. These requirements describe
the expected attributes and capabilities of the system and allocate capabilities to
specific components within the Clarus system. The high-level requirements in
this document are limited to those that can be derived from a context diagram
(Figure 8) that pictures the Clarus system as a single functional block with its
interfaces. The types of high-level requirements described in this section
correspond roughly to these functions and interfaces. Functional requirements
describe what happens inside the Clarus system itself: quality checking,
development, and packaging of environmental data. Each interface to the Clarus
system has its own requirements with regard to the collection of data from
providers as input; the dissemination of data for output; the controlling rules and
constraints under which the system operates; and the means (primarily data
management) by which it works.
Figure 8 – High-Level Requirements Context
The high-level perspective assumed for these requirements has implications for
downstream development activities. The high-level requirements provide a basis
for components in system elaboration, and detailed requirements are subsequently
tied to specific components. Conformance to high-level requirements is shown
through testing based on plans derived from the detailed requirements. The entire
development process is tied together by lines of traceability anchored in the high-
level requirements.
In this section, the requirements are classified by the first letter in the requirement
identification as described in Table 2 and shown in Table 3.
• Functional Requirements – Lists the characteristics that the system must
support for each interface. Identifies what is to be done by the system,
Clarus Weather System Design

what inputs should be transformed to what outputs, and what specific
operations are required. The functional requirements further include:
• Functional Data Requirements, which describe requirements
specific to the definition and management of data used and
provided by the system; and
• Functional Interface Requirements, which describe the functional
interfaces to the Clarus system from information providers and
consumers.
• Performance Requirements – Specifies static and dynamic capacity for the
number of users, connections, and other performance related factors.
Performance requirements further include:
• Design Constraints, which identify constraints imposed by
standards, regulations, software or hardware limitations; and
• Quality Requirements, which provide requirements which address
the general quality, usability, extensibility, flexibility, and
maintainability of the system.
• Organizational Requirements – Includes requirements for policies and
procedures to support the implementation, operations, training, and
institutional requirements to support the system. This category also:
• Details logical characteristics between the system and external data
sources;
• Specifies level of integration with external systems and defines the
interfaces with each user class; and
• Specifies any communications interfaces and protocols that should
be supported.
Table 2 shows the general layout of the requirements tables, and explains the
purpose or content of each column of the requirements table. The requirements in
this document are a subset of the requirements information that will be tracked in
the system “Requirements Matrix.” While this document is intended to record the
requirements that apply to a particular implementation of the system, the
Requirements Matrix tracks all proposed requirements for the system. The matrix
includes requirements that may apply to future versions of the system or which
have been deferred due to cost or complexity.
Table 3 provides an explanation of the requirement identification numbering
system. The high-level requirements are identified as A-NNN, where A is the
classification and NNN is a unique number. The detailed requirements are
identified as A-NNNUU, where A-NNN is the parent or high-level requirement
and UU is a unique identifier.
This section lists the functional characteristics that the system must support. It
also identifies what is to be done by the system, what inputs should be
transformed to what outputs, and what specific operations are required. The

functional requirements are broken into subsections by each allocation to specific
modules listed in Table 4.
Detailed requirements are associated with a parent or high-level requirement.
They are used by developers in creating the design for the Clarus system, by
testers to ensure all requirements are implemented during the build of the Clarus
system, and by the client for documenting their expectations.
Many of the high-level requirements are allocated to more than one module or
component of the Clarus system. Within each table, the high-level requirements
show their allocations to particular modules. If the high-level requirement is
allocated to more than one module, then the high-level requirement will be
repeated in the corresponding allocation’s module.
Following the high-level requirement, detailed requirement(s) are shown to create
more refined requirements specific to the associated module. Figure 7 may be
referenced while reviewing the detailed requirements to maintain context of the
Clarus system’s architecture.

APPENDIX B - SUPPLEMENTAL DESCRIPTION OF
CLARUS QC TESTS
The Clarus detailed requirements describe QC tests to be implemented as Clarus
standard tests. This appendix provides descriptions of these QC test methods as a
means of clarifying the intended implementations. These descriptions should not
be interpreted, however, as further elaborations of requirements or as design
specifications. The Clarus system design descriptions will provide the final
specifications and will be subject to formal design review.
Manual Quality Test
The Clarus manual quality test allows authorized Clarus personnel to flag
particular observations as “passed” or “failed” independent of the automated
analysis. For instance, if a network manager communicates to Clarus that one of
its stations has a temperature bias, then that station’s temperature data can be
manually flagged as “failed” until the network corrects the problem. If a Clarus
QA meteorologist determines that suspicious-looking snow depth data are from a
real, meteorological event, that station’s snow depth can be manually flagged as
“passed” until the event ends. Observations that have received manual quality
checks need not be run through the automated quality checks (Fiebrich and
Crawford 2001).
Sensor Range Test
The Clarus range test will flag any observation that lies outside of the pre-
determined range threshold values as “failed”. The threshold values will usually
be determined via sensor specifications or theoretical limits (Meek and Hatfield
1994). For instance, the range for relative humidity would likely be 0 to 100%.
Observations that have received range filter flags of “failed” need not be run
through the automated quality checks.
Climate Test
The Clarus climate test will flag any observation that exceeds defined, variable-
specific climatological ranges as “failed” (Reek et al., 1992). Otherwise, the
observation will be flagged as “passed”. The Clarus climatological threshold
values will be station-specific and will be based on either regional extremes or
individual station extremes (if they are available).
Barnes Spatial Test
The Clarus Barnes spatial test will calculate an estimate for each observation
using a one-pass Barnes objective analysis routine (Barnes 1964, Shafer et al.
2000). Neighboring observations will be weighted according to their distance
from the station that is being estimated:
Ze = ∑
w(ri)zi
w(ri )
∑
,

where Ze is the estimated value, zi are the neighboring observations, and w is the
weighting, based on the neighboring site’s distance to the site in question. The
weighting decreases exponentially with distance from the station:
W (ri) = e
−ri
2
ko .
The weight function, ko, is determined by the Barnes analysis based upon the
mean station spacing. The standard deviation, σ, of the observations within the
radius of influence is calculated. The ratio of the difference between the observed
(Zo) and estimated (Ze) values to the analysis’ standard deviation is defined as:
∆= Ze − Zo
σ
.
The Clarus Barnes spatial test will fail any observation whose value differs by
more than three standard deviations from its estimated value (i.e., ∆ > 3).
Otherwise, the Clarus Barnes spatial test will pass the observation, and list the ∆
value with the QC flag to indicate the confidence in the observation. For instance,
a ∆ value of 1.5 would indicate that the observation was within 1.5 standard
deviations of its expected value. Further analysis may indicate that the Barnes
spatial test should have the ability to incorporate background fields (e.g., ADAS
or RUC analysis from the previous hour) into the analysis to compensate for
regions that have inadequate spatial or temporal coverage.
Optimal Interpolation Spatial Test
The Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test will calculate an estimate for each
observation using a univariate optimal-interpolation technique (Belousov et al.,
1968). Specifically, the test will use the nearest observation in each of eight
directional sectors distributed around the observation (Miller and Benjamin,
1992). If the difference between the observation and estimate is “small”, the
observation is flagged as “passed”, and the difference between the observation
and the estimate is listed to indicate the confidence in the observation. The
threshold for “small” is a function of the expected analysis error, which is
dependent on location and density of the neighboring observations (Gandin, 1963,
and Miller and Benjamin, 1991). If the difference is large, then neighboring
observations are successively eliminated from the analysis to determine whether
the discrepancy was caused by an erroneous observation from a neighboring site.
If successively eliminating a neighboring station from the analysis results in a
value that agrees with the observation, then the observation is flagged as
“passed”. The difference between the observation and the estimate indicates the
confidence in the observation. In addition, the suspicious neighboring observation
is not used in the analysis of other stations. If successive eliminations of
neighboring stations does not result in an estimated value that agrees with the
observation, the observation is flagged as “failed”.
The Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial check will incorporate a background
field (e.g., ADAS or RUC analysis from the previous hour) into the analysis to
compensate for regions that have inadequate spatial or temporal coverage. Miller

and Benjamin (1992) found that subtracting the background field before
performing the analysis improved error detection.
Step Test
The Clarus step test will flag all observations whose consecutive values in time
exceed predefined variable-specific step threshold values as “failed” (Fiebrich and
Crawford 2001). For instance, if a pressure observation changes by greater than
10 hPa in five minutes, the observation is flagged as “failed”. As another
example, if a temperature observation changes by greater than 10 °C in five
minutes, the observation would be flagged as “failed”.
Persistence Test
The Clarus persistence test will flag all observations whose consecutive values in
time remain the same for a predefined variable-specific persistence threshold
value during a defined time interval as “failed” (Oklahoma Climatological
Survey). For instance, if a pressure observation remains unchanged (to the nearest
pascal) for more than 30 minutes, the observation would be flagged as “failed”.
As another example, if a temperature observation remains unchanged (to the
nearest tenth of a °C) for more than 120 minutes, the observation would be
flagged as “failed”.
Like Instrument Test
The Clarus like instrument test will flag all observations that differ from the
corresponding like-instrument observations by more than a predefined variable-
specific threshold value as “failed” (Fiebrich and Crawford 2001). For instance, if
the wind speed at 10 m differs from the wind speed at 2 m by more than 5 ms-1,
then the observation would be flagged as “failed”.
Potential Temperature Test
The Clarus potential temperature test will flag all temperature observations whose
potential temperatures fail the Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test as
“failed”. Elevation differences will be incorporated to help model the horizontal
correlation between mountain stations (Miller and Benjamin 1992).
Dew Point Temperature Test
The Clarus dew point temperature test will flag all temperature and relative
humidity observations whose resulting dew point values fail the Clarus Barnes
spatial test or the Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test as “failed” (Oklahoma
Climatological Survey).
Sea Level Pressure Test
The Clarus sea level pressure test will flag all pressure observations whose
computed sea level pressure values fail the Clarus Barnes spatial test or the
Clarus Optimal Interpolation spatial test as “failed” (Oklahoma Climatological
Survey).

Theoretical Solar Radiation Test
The Clarus theoretical solar radiation test will flag all downwelling short wave
radiation observations whose values exceed the theoretical solar radiation for the
site’s latitude, longitude, and day of year as “failed” (Oklahoma Climatological
Survey).
Precipitation Amount Test
The Clarus precipitation amount test would flag all precipitation amount
observations whose values differ from the radar-estimated precipitation amount
by more than a pre-determined threshold as “failed”. The nearest or best radar to
use for each location would be configurable. This technique is still being
researched and is not recommended for Clarus proof-of-concept implementation
(Oklahoma Climatological Survey).
Wind Direction Test
The Clarus wind direction test will function the same way as the Barnes and
Optimal Interpolation spatial tests do, with the exception that wind direction
estimates will be calculated from directional means (rather than arithmetic
means). In addition, the wind direction observation will be subject to this test only
if its associated wind speed observations are greater than 3 ms-1 (Oklahoma
Climatological Survey). For instance, wind directions with associated wind
speeds of 0-3 ms-1 will not be tested, because wind direction is highly variable
during calm/light winds.
Soil Moisture Change Test
The Clarus soil moisture change test will function similarly to the step test except
that different thresholds will be set for changes in moistening versus drying. For
instance, the observations will be allowed to moisten more rapidly than they will
be allowed to dry (Oklahoma Climatological Survey 2005).
Soil Moisture Freeze Test
The Clarus soil moisture freeze test will flag all observations whose associated
subsurface temperatures are below freezing as “failed”. Most soil moisture
sensors do not operate correctly when the soil is frozen (Oklahoma Climatological
Survey 2005).

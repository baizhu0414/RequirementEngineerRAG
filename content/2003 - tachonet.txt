Types of Requirements
Definition
A requirement is defined as "a condition or capability to which a system must
conform".
Functional requirements specify actions that a system must be able to perform,
without taking physical constraints into consideration. These are often best described
in a use-case model and in use cases. Functional requirements thus specify the input
and output behaviour of a system.
Requirements that are not functional are sometimes called non-functional
requirements. Many requirements are non-functional, and describe only attributes
of the system or attributes of the system environment.
FURPS+
There are a many different kinds of requirements. One way of categorizing them is
described as the FURPS+ model [GRA92], using the acronym FURPS to describe
the major categories of requirements with subcategories as shown below.
? Functionality,
? Usability,
? Reliability,
? Performance and
? Supportability
The "+" in FURPS+ helps you to also remember to also include such requirements as
? design constraints,
? interface requirements and
? physical requirements.
Functionality
(FUN)
Functional requirements may include:
? feature sets,
? capabilities, and
? security.

Types of Requirements, Continued
Usability (USA) Usability requirements may include such sub-categories as:
? human factors,
? aesthetics,
? consistency in the user interface,
? online and context-sensitive help,
? wizards and agents,
? user documentation, and
? training materials.
Reliability
(REL)
Reliability requirements to be considered are:
? Availability (percentage of time available, hours of use, maintenance access,…)
? frequency / severity of failure,
? recoverability,
? predictability,
? accuracy, and
? mean time between failure (MTBF).
Performance
(PER)
A performance requirement imposes conditions on functional requirements. For
example, for a given action, it may specify performance parameters for:
? throughput (e.g. transactions per second),
? response time,
? recovery time, or
? resource usage (memory, disk, cpu,…).

Types of Requirements, Continued
Supportability
(SUP)
Supportability requirements may include:
? testability,
? extensibility,
? adaptability,
? maintainability,
? compatibility,
? configurability,
? serviceability,
? installability, or
? localizability (internationalization).
Design
Requirement
(DES)
A design requirement, often called a design constraint, specifies or constrains the
design of a system.
This section should indicate any design constraints on the system being built. Design
constraints represent design decisions that have been mandated and must be adhered
to. Examples include software languages, software process requirements, prescribed
use of developmental tools, architectural and design constraints, purchased
components, class libraries, etc.
Interface
Requirement
(INT)
This section defines the interfaces that must be supported by the application. It
should contain adequate specificity, protocols, ports and logical addresses, etc., so
that the software can be developed and verified against the interface requirements.
An interface requirement may be classified into:
? User interface (user interfaces that are to be implemented by the software)
? Hardware interface (hardware interfaces that are to be supported by the software,
including logical structure, physical addresses, expected behavior, etc.)
? Software interface (software interfaces to other components of the software
system. These may be purchased components, components reused from another
application or components being developed for subsystems outside of the scope
of this project, but with which this software application must interact).

Physical
Requirement
(HAR)
A physical requirement specifies a physical characteristic that a system must possess;
for example,
? material,
? shape,
? size, and
? weight.
This type of requirement can be used to represent hardware requirements, such as
? the physical network configurations required
Applicable
Standards
Requirements
(STD)
This section describes by reference any applicable standards and the specific sections
of any such standards that apply to the system being described. For example, this
could include legal, quality and regulatory standards, industry standards for usability,
interoperability, internationalization, operating system compliance, etc.

List of Functional Requirements
Introduction
Functional requirements specify actions that a system must be able to perform,
without taking physical constraints into consideration. Functional requirements thus
specify the input and output behaviour of a system.
A list of these functional requirements is given below with an identification and a
short description for each of them.
These functional requirements are best described once translated into use cases (see
Use Case Model chapter).
List of
functional
requirements
Each identified functional requirement is assigned a unique key “FUN-nn” where nn
is a sequence number identifying the functional requirement. The table hereafter lists
all the functional requirements :

Introduction
What’s a Use-
Case Model ?
A use-case model is a model of the system's intended functions and its surroundings.
It serves as a contract between the customer, the users and the system developers on
the functionality of the system, which allows :
? Customers and users to validate that the system will become what they
expected.
? System developers to build what is expected.
The same use-case model is used in system analysis, design, implementation, and
testing.
The use-case model consists of use cases and actors.
What’s an
Actor ?
An actor defines a coherent set of roles that users of the system can play when
interacting with it. A user can either be an individual or an external system.
What’s a Use
Case ?
A use case defines a set of use-case instances, where each instance is a sequence of
actions a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular
actor. Each use case in the model is described in detail, showing step-by-step how
the system interacts with the actors, and what the system does in the use case. Use
cases function as a unifying thread throughout the software lifecycle.

Actor Catalog
Introduction
This map describes the list of identified actors.
List of actors
The following figure describes the different actors:
CIA Application
CIA Administrator
TCNAdministrator
A CIA Administrator isa single user who is in charge of administering the CIA application
(exchanging XML messages with TACHOnet) in a Member State.
From the TACHOnet viewpoint, the CIA Administrator will be assigned an account and will be
granted the rights to browse the TCN usage statistics reports through a secure web site.
TACHOnet considers a whole CIA (Card Issuing Authority) as a single user (the CIA administrator
excepted) through the CIA application, in charge of exchanging XML messages with TACHOnet.
TACHOnet does not manage CIA users working with the CIA application (e.g. the clerks or
enforcers performing administrative tasks). These latter ones have to be managed accordingly by
each Member State's CIA under their own responsibility.
From the TACHOnet viewpoint, the CIA application acts as a single user and will be defined
accordingly (a single digital certificate will be delivered for a CIA application). Therefore,
enforcers are also considered as CIA users who should then be managed by each Member State
(TACHOnet only have a SPOC CIA).
A CIA Application will be granted the rights for carrying out any of the administrative tasks(see
Administrative tasksfor more details).
The TCN (TACHOnet) Administrator is in charge of administering the whole TACHOnet
services in terms of configuration, performance, logging, tracking,... .
The TCN Administrator is not related to any CIA and works for the EC or Trusted Third Party
company hosting and managing the TACHOnet services.
CIA User
Even though TACHOnet doesn't manage any CIA user (see above), a CIA user (i.e. clerks or
enforcers) may have access to a web application providing a user interface on top of the
TACHOnet web servcices (phonex and transliteration).

Use Case 01 – Check driver(s)’ issued cards
Description
This use case consists of processing a request for checking driver’s issued card
coming from a Card Issuing Authority (CIA). Such request could contain the data for
a single driver (online mode) or several drivers (batch mode).
This use case is also used by enforcers (on behalf of CIA – as TACHOnet only sees
CIA as SPOC) during road checks.
Basic flow
The basic flow consists of the following steps:
Step
Action
1
TACHOnet deciphers the received request and logs the received request
as-is in its tracking database.
2
TACHOnet validates its syntax and assigns it a TACHOnet refid
(TCNRefId).
3
TACHOnet will build as many new requests as issuing Member State
codes identified in the original request (+ another one for all sub-
requests not mentioning any issuing Member State code) by applying
defined name encoding rules to the given surname(s) and first name(s) in
order to compute the search keys.
4
For each issuing Member State identified (if any) in the original request,
TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts a new request (only containing
sub-requests for the corresponding issuing Member State), sends it to the
corresponding Member State’s CIA application and waits for receiving
the response.
For the sub-request mentioning any issuing Member State code (if any),
TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts a new request (only containing
sub-requests not mentioning any issuing Member State), broadcasts it to
all the Member States configured in TACHOnet (except the Member
State having sent the original request) and waits for receiving each

For each received response, TACHOnet deciphers it, logs it as-is in its
tracking database and validates its syntax. If it is valid, TACHOnet
stores the response data (linked to the TCN refid) in the database (for
later building the single consolidated response that TACHOnet will send
when all responses are received or when the timeout is reached).
6
When all responses are received or when the timeout is reached,
TACHOnet builds, from the received responses stored in its database,
the single consolidated response.

TACHOnet logs the consolidated response is in its tracking database,
encrypts it and sends it to the original caller.

Alternate
flow
Description
ALT-01
When TACHOnet receives a negative response from a Member State
CIA, it should log it and consider the request sent to that Member
State CIA as completed (with error).
ALT-02
When TACHOnet receives multiple responses (corresponding to a
single request) from a Member State CIA, it should ignore the
superfluous additional responses. The first received response is the
processed one.
ALT-03
When TACHOnet doesn’t receive within time a Member State CIA
response, it should mention ‘timeout’ as status code for that Member
State CIA in the consolidated response.
ALT-04
When TACHOnet receives a late Member State CIA response, it
should log it and ignore it.
ALT-05
When TACHOnet receives a syntactically invalid request / response,
it should always send back a negative receipt with ‘Invalid Format
request’ as status code and warn the TCN Administrator.
ALT-06
When TACHOnet receives an invalid XML message (request,
response), it will respond with a negative receipt mentioning the
reason (invalid format).

Use Case 02 – Check tachograph card status
Description
This use case consists of checking the status of a tachograph card based on its card
number. This use case is very useful for CIAs in order to check the validity of a card
prior to performing some administrative tasks (e.g. to avoid from declaring a
lost/stolen card for a wrongly keyed-in card number,...). It is also useful for
enforcement authorities during road-checks where workshop could also be checked
(beside driver cards).
The checked card is identified by its card number and its issuing Member State code.
As an issued card must be unique, it should only exist in a single CIA data store (the
CIA having issued the card).
Basic flow
The basic flow consists of the following steps:
Step
Action
1
TACHOnet deciphers the received request and logs the received request
as-is in its tracking database.
2
TACHOnet validates its syntax and assigns it a TACHOnet refid
(TCNRefId).
3
TACHOnet will build as many new requests as issuing Member State
codes identified in the original request. TACHOnet figures out the target
issuing Member State(s) from the issuing Member State code given for
each to-be-checked card. Every new request only contains card
number(s) issued by a particular Member State.
4
For each identified issuing Member State(s), TACHOnet builds, logs and
encrypts the new request, sends it to it and waits for receiving the
response.
5
For each received response, TACHOnet deciphers it, logs it as-is in its
tracking database and validates its syntax. If it’s valid, TACHOnet stores
the response message (linked to the TCNRefId) in the database (for later
building the single consolidated response that TACHOnet will send
when all responses are received or when the timeout is reached).
6
When all responses are received or when the timeout is reached,
TACHOnet builds, logs and encrypts the consolidated response (from
the responses received so far), and sends it to the original caller.
Alternate flows The same alternate flows as described for UC-01 (page 23) may exist depending on
the result of some events/actions of the basic flow.

The card status values in red ('Y' in 2nd column) will be defined as the only values allowed as
new card status values in the TCN "ModCardStatus" transaction (XML message). TCN will not
check the validity of the state transition declared in this transaction (e.g. it will not prevent
declaring a card 'Exchanged' while its current status was 'Stolen' as TCN doesn't know the
current card status). It's up the MS responsibility to check the validity of such state transition
(and return a ModStatusCode=CardStatusInvalid in the XML response message).

Use Case 04 – Send Card/Driving License Assignment
Description
This use case is born from the “Luxemburg agreement” (see [3] for more details). It
should be used by CIAs in the particular case when a card has been issued to a driver
who showed a foreign driving license. The CIA must then warn, via TACHOnet, the
Member State having issued the driving license that a brand new card has been
issued with the corresponding driving license number. Upon receipt of such request,
the Member State having issued the driving license should store that information
(issued card number associated to the driving license number) in its own local data
store.
Basic flow
The basic flow consists of the following steps:
Step
Action
1
TACHOnet deciphers the received request and logs the received request
as-is in its tracking database.
2
TACHOnet validates its syntax and assigns it a TACHOnet refid
(TCNRefId).
3
TACHOnet will build as many new requests as issuing Member State
codes identified in the original request (e.g. if more than one card/driving
license number is given in the request). TACHOnet figures out the issuing
Member State code(s) based on the driving license issuing nation (and not
the card issuing Member State code) given for each sub request. Every
new request only contains card and driving license number(s) issued by a
particular Member State.
4
For each identified issuing Member State(s), TACHOnet builds, logs and
encrypts the new request, sends it to the Member State and waits for
receiving the response.
5
For each received response, TACHOnet deciphers it, logs it as-is in its
tracking database and validates its syntax. If it’s valid, TACHOnet stores

Use Case 05 – Get Phonex Search Keys
Description
This use case consists of getting from TACHOnet the computed search keys (based
on the Phonex algorithm) corresponding to the given last name and first names.
The Member State CIAs should call upon this service when issuing a new card to get
the computed search keys of the driver’s surname and first names, so to store them in
their local data store. When a Member State CIA will receive a TACHOnet request
for checking driver’s issued card, it should use the search keys given in the request to
search against their local data store (along with the given driver’s birth date). It’s
therefore of major importance to use a common algorithm and to store computed
search keys in the local data store.
Nevertheless, Member States are free to use their own Phonetic algorithm (if existing
like in Germany). In such a case, it’s the Member State responsibility to compute the
search keys based on the given driver’s surname and first of the first names.
Basic flow
The basic flow consists of the following steps:
Step
Action
1
The CIA calls the TACHOnet service giving the driver’s surname and
first names.
2
TACHOnet checks the input parameters and, if valid, computes the
corresponding surname and first of the first names search keys.
3
TACHOnet returns the computed search keys as output parameters.
Alternate flows 2a
If the input parameters are invalid (e.g. illegal character,…), TACHOnet
returns a negative status code to the request.
Special
requirements
• This service should ideally be implemented as a synchronous Web Service.
• A web interface on top of this service should also be supplied to allow the CIA
users to access manually these TACHOnet services.
• A downloadable version of this web service should also be made available (.NET
and Java) to enable some Member States to install and use it locally.
Pre-conditions
The caller must provide the mandatory input parameters.
Post-conditions The caller has received the computed search keys (or a negative error code).

Use Case 09 – “Generate Statistics”
Brief
Description
This use case consists of transferring (at regular interval – nightly basis) all expired
TACHOnet transactions (completed or after timeout), storing them and generating
some usage statistics for the TCN Administrator and every CIA Administrators.
The usage statistics should give information about the incoming requests (from a
CIA to TACHOnet) for a given period:
? The list of requests for the last 14 days (List).
? The percentage of each status code values (Timeout, ServerError,…) for each
CIA (Consolidated chart).
? The count and percentage of each status code values for each CIA (Consolidated
list).
? The count and percentage of each CIA for each type of requests (Consolidated
list).
? The count and percentage of each type of requests (CheckIssuedCards,
CheckCardStatus,…) for each mode – Batch and On-line - (Consolidated list).
The usage statistics should give information about the outgoing requests (from
TACHOnet to a CIA) for a given period:
? The list of requests for the last 14 days (List).
? The percentage of OK status code value for each CIA (Consolidated chart).
? The percentage of each status code values (Timeout, ServerError,…) for each
CIA (Consolidated chart).
? The count and percentage of each status code values for each CIA (Consolidated
list).
? The count and percentage of each CIA for each type of requests (Consolidated
list).
? The count and percentage of each type of requests for each mode – Batch and
On-line - (Consolidated list).
The consolidated lists should also give information about the minimum, maximum
and average value of the time it took to complete the transaction and for the given
timeout value.

Use Case 11 – Log the message
Description
This use case consists of logging as-is every message sent or received by
TACHOnet.
Such logging is provided out-of-the-box by BizTalk and will be configured at the
channel level using the BizTalk Messaging Manager tool.
Basic flow
The basic flow consists of the following steps:
Step
Action
1
Upon receiving a message, TACHOnet should log it as-is in the tracking
database.
2
Prior to sending a message, TACHOnet should log it as-is in the tracking
database.
Alternate flows • TACHOnet should also provide a system for archiving (e.g. removing from the
tracking database to flat files) “old” messages (how long should TACHOnet keep
track of a message?).
Special
requirements
• Great care must be taken when setting up the tracking database in terms of sizing
(the number of the messages to be logged might quickly become huge),
performance (the logging mechanism should not impede overall TACHOnet
system performance), availability (high availability must be guaranteed through
clustering,...) and security (restricted administrative access, strong backup
policies,...).
Pre-conditions
• A message (request, response) is received by TACHOnet or about to be sent by
TACHOnet.
Post-conditions • The received/sent message is logged in the tracking database
Actors
• TACHOnet system

Use-Case 12 – “Monitor the system”
Brief
Description
This use case consists of monitoring the whole TACHOnet system.
Such monitoring will be based on the MOM (Microsoft Operations Manager)
product, used as standard monitoring tool by the EC DI’s Data Center.
Managing BizTalk through MOM is made possible by installing the BizTalk
Management Pack for MOM. Nevertheless, as this pack consists of more than 700
rules, some configuration need to be made (in close collaboration with EC DI’s Data
Center people) to configure the set of rules required for monitoring the BizTalk
configuration of TACHOnet.
Primary Actor
? TCN Administrator
Preconditions
The TCN Administrator has access to the MOM console.
Postconditions
The TCN Administrator has managed alerts sent through the MOM console.
Stakeholders
and Interests
In order to constantly keep the availability and performance of the TACHOnet
system at an optimum level, the system must constantly monitored and should raise
some events when particular problems (HW, SW,…) occur.
Basic Flow
See MOM documentation.
Technology and
Data Variations
List
-
Assumptions
? MOM is used as central monitoring system.
Open issues
? Will the TACHOnet servers be directly monitored from the central MOM
console or should TACHOnet provide ?
? Is there any special FW configuration between the TACHOnet servers and the
central MOM console?
? What are the BizTalk rules that need be configured in MOM and how?

Use-Case 13 – “Manage Member State”
Brief
Description
This use case consists of managing a Member State CIA in terms of TACHOnet
configuration (add, edit, remove a Member State CIA).
Primary Actor
? TCN Administrator
Preconditions
The TCN Administrator has access to the BizTalk Messaging Manager and
BizTalk Server Administration tools.
Postconditions
The Member State CIA configuration in TACHOnet has been updated.
Stakeholders
and Interests
All Member States will not be ready at production day 1. Moreover, new candidate
Member States will potentially join TACHOnet in the near future. The configuration
of existing Member States could also change. Therefore, it’s important to provide the
TCN Administrator with the tools or procedures to manage the TACHOnet
configuration of a Member State.
Basic Flow
Managing Member States consists of adding a new Member State or modifying the
current configuration of a Member State (url address, digital certificates,…) or
removing a Member State (?). All these manual tasks will be described in details in
the “TCN Operational Guide” document. Anyway, some of these major tasks are
outlined below:
Adding a new Member State:
The following table lists the activities to carry out to add a new Member State in the
TACHOnet configuration:
? BizTalk configuration:
? Create the BizTalk organization corresponding to the new Member State
(“TCN_<countrycode>”) with its relevant properties.
? Create the corresponding BizTalk messaging ports.
? Create the corresponding BizTalk distribution list (“All-
<countrycode>”).
? Update all the other BizTalk distribution lists to add the new messaging port
(send request) corresponding to the new Member State.
? Create the corresponding BizTalk channels.
? Create the corresponding BizTalk receive functions (in test environment).
? Reporting System:
? Add a new CIA Administrator account

Use-Case 13 – “Manage Member State”, Continued
Basic Flow
(continued)
Modifying the current configuration of a Member State:
? Changing the phone/fax/email of the Member State:
? Update the custom properties of the BizTalk organization corresponding to
the Member State
? Changing the url address where TACHOnet should send XML messages:
? Update the transport type of the BizTalk messaging port corresponding to
the Member State.
Technology and ? BizTalk Server 2002 provides the necessary tools to manage its configuration.
Data Variations
List
These will be leveraged to update the Member States configuration.
Assumptions
The TCN Administrator is a BizTalk Administrator and has access to the BizTalk
Messaging Manager and BizTalk Server Administration tools (or
will delegate to the effective BizTalk Administrator).

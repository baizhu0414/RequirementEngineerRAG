1 SCOPE
The purpose of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS)
Data Exploitation (NDE) System Requirements Specification is to identify the system requirements
that will support customer needs for products from the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) satellite,
as well as the NPOESS satellites that are part of the NPOESS program.  These requirements also
serve as the primary focal point for the traceability of all lower level or derived requirements
documented in other NDE deliverables.
1.1 System Overview
NOAA’s NPOESS Data Exploitation (NDE) system will receive data from the NPOESS Interface
Data Processing Segment (IDPS), process and package it to meet user requirements, ensure
appropriate NDE unique products are archived, distribute data to authorized users, and provide
customer service to users of its products.
NDE’s primary mission is to provide products derived from NPOESS observations to NOAA’s
operational and climate communities and to other civilian customers. In order to fulfill the mission,
NDE will acquire the resources necessary to achieve the following objectives:
•
Disseminate NPOESS Data Records from the IDPS to  customers
•
Generate and disseminate tailored NPOESS Data Records (versions of NPOESS Data
Records in previously agreed alternative formats and views)
•
Generate and disseminate NOAA-unique products (augmented environmental products
constructed from NPOESS Data Records)
•
Deliver NOAA-unique products and associated metadata to the NOAA’s long term archive,
the Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS)
•
Provide services to customers, including a Help Desk, NDE product training, product
enhancement, and implementation support across NOAA
•
Coordinate NPOESS-related activities across NOAA  -
− Assist with planning for the implementation of NPOESS data by user systems -
− Ensure end-user preparedness for NPOESS data
•
Develop a sustainable system that meets its customer needs
•
Provide software for NPOESS Data Record format conversion
In order to support these objectives, the NDE System will be partitioned into Operational (OPS),
System Test (TEST), and Development (DEV) Environments.  Each environment will be designed
for a specific purpose for both the NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) era, as well as the NPOESS
C1 and C2 eras.
1.2 Document Overview
The System Requirements Specification is based on the IEEE/EIA 12207 Standard for Software Life
Cycle Processes published in 1995 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  This

document was created and published using the DOORS 7.1 automated requirements management
tool.
1.3 Definitions
These definitions are used throughout the System Requirements Specification:
Component - refers to Hardware, equipment, and licensed software products (i.e., Operating
Systems, DBMS, middleware, COTS or GOTS products, CASE tools, etc.), used in discussions of
NDE infrastructure.
Element - refers to In-house developed capabilities (i.e., the source code for algorithms, programs,
utilities, control tables, called procedures, etc.), used in discussions of NDE infrastructure.
Product Latency - The point in time when all of the required xDRs needed to create a product are
successfully ingested and the point in time where the product is made available for distribution to
customers.
System - refers to the assemblage of entity/objects comprising the whole of NDE, with each and
every component/element interacting or related to at least one other component/element.
Tool - refers to a component used by the NDE development staff in the process of creating, testing,
organizing, or tracking NDE components/elements, but not incorporated into the architecture of the
operational or test systems (e.g., a requirements management tool).

workflows of components in a system.
A-DCS  Advanced Data Collection System
Application Server An application server is a software engine that delivers applications to
client computers. Moreover, an application server should handle most, if not
all, of the business logic and data access of the application.
CASE  Computer-Aided Software Engineering
CLASS Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System
Component Hardware, equipment, and licensed software products (i.e., Operating
Systems, DBMS, middleware, COTS or GOTS products, CASE tools, etc.),
used by NDE as general term in discussions of infrastructure (See Contract
Section J, Figure 38.)
Continuance of Operations Plan (COOP) A conducted three months study starting in February 2007 to evaluate
options for a NDE backup facility.
Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Infrastructure necessary to backup the NDE system.
Delivered Algorithm Package (DAP) The DAP is a single compressed tar file which contains all information
necessary so that an algorithm can be built from scratch and tested
independently of other algorithms in the NDE development and test
environments.
Drop Box A file directory or set of directories located on a system within a designated
public security zone on the network which is configured to segregate access
and provide a place to deliver and receive files necessary for other systems
to process.  The drop box sometimes refers to the hosting system or hosting
system’s file system.
Element NOAA-developed system capabilities (e.g., the source code for algorithms,
programs, utilities, control tables, called procedures, etc.), used by NDE as
general term in discussions of archiving and configuration management
(See Contract Section J, Figure 38.)
Enterprise Service Bus
(ESB)
An ESB refers to a software architecture construct that provides
foundational services for more complex architectures via an event-driven
and standards-based messaging engine (the bus). The ESB is in the category
of middleware infrastructure products.
Gazetteer A gazetteer is a geographical dictionary: Short-form gazetteers, often used
in conjunction with computer mapping and Geographic Information
Systems (GIS), may simply contain a list of place-names together with their
locations in latitude and longitude or other spatial referencing systems (eg.
British National Grid reference).
Middleware Middleware is computer software that connects software components or
applications. It is used most often to support complex, distributed
applications. It includes web servers, application servers, content
management systems, and similar tools that support application

Science Algorithm Development and
Integration Environment (SADIE)
The SADIE is a computing environment where algorithms are integrated
with the Data Handling System (DHS).  It contains all the tools and libraries
necessary to design, develop, and do unit testing on algorithms.  It also can
receive algorithms that were developed in other environments (e.g., the
STAR Collaborative Environment) via the delivery of a Delivered
Algorithm Package (DAP).
Service A service is a unit of work done by a service provider for a service
consumer.
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
SOA is an architectural style whose goal is to achieve loose coupling
among interacting software agents.
(Source: from Wikipedia)
An architecture that relies on service-orientation as its fundamental design
principle. Service-orientation describes an architecture that uses loosely
coupled services to support the requirements of business processes and
users. Resources on a network in an SOA environment are made available
as independent services that can be accessed without knowledge of their
underlying platform implementation. These concepts can be applied to
business, software and other types of producer/consumer systems.

Subsystem A subsystem is a set of elements, which is a system itself, and a part of the
whole system.
System  A system is an assemblage of entity/objects comprising a whole with each
and every component/element interacting or related to at least one other
component/element. Any object which has no relationship with any other
element of the system is not a component of that system.
Tool Component used by NDE development staff in the process of creating,
testing, organizing, or tracking NDE elements, but not incorporated into the
architecture of the operational or test systems (e.g. a requirements
management tool).
Use Case A use case is a technique for capturing functional requirements of systems.
Each use case provides one or more scenarios that convey how the system
should interact with the users, called actor, to achieve a specific business
goal or function.
Use Case Actors End users or other systems.
Use Case Diagram Use Case Diagrams model the behavior of a system, subsystem, or class.
Virtual Private Network (VPN) A VPN is a private communications network often used within a company,
or by several companies or organizations, to communicate confidentially

over a publicly accessible network. VPN message traffic can be carried over
a public networking infrastructure (e.g. the Internet) on top of standard
protocols, or over a service provider's private network with a defined
Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN
service provider. (Source: Wikipedia)  For NDE, the VPN is used to
authorize roles and access to each user, encrypt the traffic between the
user’s system and the NDE systems accessed, and provide strong
authentication capabilities for the users.
Web Server/HTTP Server Software accepting HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests from
clients, which are known as Web browsers, and serving them HTTP
responses along with optional data contents, which usually are Web pages
such as HTML documents and linked objects (images, etc.).

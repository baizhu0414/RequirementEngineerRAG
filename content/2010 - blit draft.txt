1 Introduction
The management of [company name]. has identified a potential need for re-writing its core
Laboratory Information System (LIS) to improve the performance. In general, this project
will provide a stable environment, automate decisions, streamline workflows, and employ
industry standard coding and documentation practices. This effort will ensure System
Integrity/Reliability by developing a system that is reliable and low maintenance including
security and confidentiality requirements as dictated by HIPAA and FDA regulatory
standards.
1.1 Purpose
This Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) is intended to capture the changes in
functionality that will occur during [system name] Re-Writing effort, which is part of the xxx
Enhancements project. All functionalities for the new [system name] system would be
documented in this FRS. Any undocumented requirements will be considered out of scope
and will not be implemented during this phase of Re-Writing.
1.2 Scope
The existing functionalities in the core [system name] will remain same. This project is
limited in scope to the enhancements and defects that are critical in the severity level that is
the issues that cause great burden to the system users and the enhancements in system
architecture, which will facilitate efficient growth of [system name] and the [company name]
business, will fall under the purview of this project scope.
The functional issues and requirements that will be discussed and gathered respectively as
well as validated in the Requirements Gathering and Validating Sessions started on
MM/DD/YYYYwould be documented in this FRS moving forward. The project team has
decided that system development will occur on module by module basis.

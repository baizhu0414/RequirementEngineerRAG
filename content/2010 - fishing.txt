2 UK Fishing Vessel’s Electronic Logbook Functional Requirements
Specification
2.1
Introduction
Council Regulation (EC) No. 1966/2006 introduces a requirement for EC fishing vessels exceeding 15 metres in overall
length (some 780 UK fishing vessels fall into this category) to use electronic logbooks rather than record and submit
fishing activity on paper logbooks as is currently required.  This will be done in two stages with the initial stage applying
only to fishing vessels exceeding 24 metres in overall length by 1 January 2010 (some 280 UK vessels) and the second
stage for those vessels exceeding 15 metres in overall length (a further 500 UK vessels) by 1 July 2011 (applies from 1
January 2011 if fishing within waters of a 3rd Country – Council Regulation (EC) No. 1006/2008).
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1077/2008 defines the detailed rules to be implemented by Member States:
Article 4 refers to the reports required from fishing vessels.  The annex to this functional specification provides
the data definitions that are required from UK fishing vessels’ onboard electronic logbook software systems in
order to fulfil the regulatory requirements to report to the UK fisheries administrations.  All electronic reports
from UK fishing vessels are required to be transmitted to the Electronic Recording and Reporting System (ERS)
of the UK fisheries administrations as appropriate in order to comply with the applicable fishing regulations.
This specification is intended to assist UK fishing vessel masters, owners and their representatives in ensuring that the
Electronic Logbook Software System (ELSS) used on board their vessels records and provides the required logbook
information for transmission in accordance with the reporting requirements set out in Council Regulation (EC) No.
1966/2006 and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1077/2008.
2.2
Functional Requirements Specification
2.2.1
General Requirements
The ELSS must capture all data necessary for recording the fishing activities undertaken by a UK fishing vessel.
The ELSS must output the data as an XML file for transmission to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system.
The ELSS data must be validated against the UK XML/XSD before transmission from the fishing vessel.
The ELSS data must be transmitted at the required times set out below in Section 2.5.1.
Each ELSS data transmission will be acknowledged by a return message from the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS
system.
2.3
Data Capture Functions
2.3.1
Data Operations
There are four main Data Operations required to be processed by the ELSS.  These Operation Types are:
• Data operation to capture and deliver formatted ELSS data for transmission by a vessel’s communications system(s)
to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system (DAT)
• Delete operation to capture and deliver a formatted deletion request for transmission by a vessel’s communications
system(s) to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system to delete previously send data (DEL)
• Correction operation to capture and deliver a formatted correction request for transmission by a vessel’s
communications system(s) to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system to correct previously send data (COR)
• Receipt of acknowledgment operation  to  match acknowledgement with original message and provide a
record/report of acknowledged and un-acknowledged transmissions
See below for detail on header data for transmissions from each operation

2.3.3
Data Definitions
The data definitions for each report type that are required to be transmitted from the ELSS of a UK fishing vessel are to
be found in the annex to this specification.  The data definitions and associated lists of valid codes are incorporated in the
UK XML/XSD definitions.  These are available to all ELSS suppliers from the UK FMC.
The data definitions also provide for the capture of data items required for the submission of ELSS data to meet 3rd
country requirements, e.g. Norway’s requirements that include haul by haul reporting.
The ELSS may also provide the means for recording additional data but this must not interfere with the data capture and
submission functions as set out below.
2.4
Capture Functions
The ELSS must provide data capture screens for the entry of the logbook, transhipment and landing declaration data that
is required to be transmitted to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system.
The ELSS must use English (UK) localizations for all UK Electronic Logbook features.
All dates and times must be UTC.
The Electronic Logbook data may be populated from other, existing, onboard electronic systems, e.g. a GPS for inserting
the date, time and location of transmission, or for inserting the same items at the time of capture, onboard weighing
systems, existing onboard database(s) to avoid duplication of data entry.
2.4.1
Printing Features
The ELSS must provide the ability to print out  the ELSS logbook data (including landing declarations) using an onboard
printer.
Additionally a formatted electronic print file may be generated out of the ELSS.  This print file can be made available to
a master’s representative on-shore, e.g. by email over the onboard communications system(s).  The ELSS must provide a
means so that electronic print files are protected so that they cannot be modified in any way once generated and
distributed.
The ELSS may provide features to facilitate other print requirements including:
• Generation of hard copies of the Electronic Logbook required when fishing in 3rd country or Regional Fisheries
waters, e.g. NAFO, Faroese and Norwegian waters.
• Generation of a hard copy logsheet or landing declaration to act as a transport or takeover document.
• Generation of a hard copy for providing regulatory returns for Cod and Hake effort reporting.
2.5
Data Transmission
The ELSS must provide Electronic Logbook data for transmission to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system in
accordance with the frequency requirements defined below (Section 5.1).
The ELSS should at least be able to transmit data via email, either by being included in a packaged solution with an email
system or by linking with an existing on-board email service. Data is required to be emailed as  an xml document
attached to an email with a standard Subject header  and sent to the email address of the UK fisheries administrations’
ERS system.
The subject header must consist of  a character string containing ‘ERS – ‘ prefixed to the contents of the GBRRN
attribute of the Electronic Logbook data being transmitted.  The GBRRN attribute is defined in the UK XML/XSD.  The
GBRRN attribute is defined uniquely as the vessels’ RSS Number appended to the current date (in YYYYMMDD
format) and a 6 digit sequence number, e.g. RSSNumber+YYYYMMDD+999999.  An example of the contents of an
email subject could be ERS – A1234520090623000001.
The xml document file name should be based upon the GBRRN attribute defined in the UK XML/XSD.  An example of
this format could be A1234520090623000001.  The RSS Number will require to be padded with trailing X’s to ensure
that it is always 6 characters in length.
Each file should have the suffix of .xml, e.g. A1234520090623000001.xml.
All xml documents attached to emails to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system must be encrypted using PGP.
It is recognised that communications methods, other than email, are available for data transmission. If an alternative is
proposed, this should be advised to the Validation Authority and if feasible and practicable the UK Fisheries
Administrations will endeavour to extend their  ERS system to accommodate alternative methods.

2.5.1
Frequency of Transmission
The ELSS must permit the Master of the vessel to generate formatted data for transmission to the UK fisheries
administrations’ ERS system.  There are 2 categories of transmission, those that must be generated automatically by the
ELSS and those that can be generated and transmitted under the control of the Master of the vessel.  The data
transmission categories are specified below:
• Automatically by the ELSS (subject to be overridden by the vessel master)
o at least on a daily basis not later than 24:00 even when there is no catch data with the proviso that if the vessel is
in port, has no fish on board and has submitted a landing declaration, transmission may be suspended subject to
prior notification to the Fisheries Monitoring Centre of the flag Member State.  Transmission must be resumed
when the vessel leaves port
o immediately after the last fishing operation has been completed
o immediately on departing port
o immediately after a transhipment
immediately on completion of the Landing declaration
• Generation and transmission under the control of the Master of the vessel
o before entering into port
o at the time of inspection at sea
o at the request of the UK fisheries administrations
2.5.2
Data Corrections
The ELSS must provide facilities to capture and deliver for transmission corrections to previously successfully
transmitted data.  Data corrections must not be transmitted piecemeal; the entire report containing one or more corrected
items must be transmitted.  There is no requirement to identify the data items that have been corrected in the generated
corrected report. .  .
All corrections must be easily identifiable within the ELSS user interface.
The ELSS must only permit correction messages to be generated and sent for reports sent during a current trip up to the
submission of the End of Fishing report for that voyage
2.5.3
Data Deletions
The ELSS must provide facilities to transmit deletions to previously transmitted data.
The ELSS must only permit deletion messages to be generated and sent for reports sent during a current trip up to the
End of Fishing report for that voyage.
All deletions must be easily identifiable within the ELSS user interface.
2.5.4
Acknowledgement
The ELSS must be able to receive acknowledgement (RET) messages transmitted from the UK fisheries administrations’
ERS system.  The ELSS must match each acknowledgement message with the appropriate transmitted data operation,
deletion or correction report.  The ELSS must be able to confirm that a transmission has been successfully acknowledged
or display any error message should the ELSS receive a negative acknowledgement message.
2.5.5
Test Transmissions
Prior to registering a product for approval, a test address for all test email transmissions and test logon details to the UK
fisheries administrations’ ERS system will be provided on request.  All requests should be made by contacting the
Validation Authority by email in the first instance.  The email address is ERS-Logbook-Approvals@NCCGroup.com.
Once operational the UK XML/XSD allows for a test message to be sent to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS
system.  This test facility must be used to send test transmissions to establish that the communications between the vessel
and the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system are fully operational.  The UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system
will acknowledge any test messages but will not store any data that has been transmitted.
2.6
Specific High Level Requirements
Some high level requirements are required of the ELSS.  These requirements are listed below;

• ELSS must retain all logbook reports and any corrections on the system at least until the end of each trip, i.e. on
submission  of the electronic landing declaration or of a transhipment report.
• Any ELSS software updates must not impact upon the ELSS’s ability to meet the requirements set out in this
document  and other test documentation . If it does then the product must be submitted for re-approval, and can not
be deployed by fishing vessels until this is granted and the new version id is published on the UKFA web site lists
• ELSS security and access controls such that
o one username/password must be provided for the owner of each vessel
o the owner is then able to set up subsidiary users such as the master of the vessel with their own
username and password.
o the username is required to be recorded in each report completed and in each transmission made; the
person who has entered the data is required to “sign” the Electronic Logbook data stating that they are
aware of the responsibilities/liabilities they are committing to in completing and / or transmitting a
report.
o Each copy of the ELSS installed must be provided with a unique (internal?) number that is
automatically entered into each transmission to identify the instance of the ELSS from which the report
has been transmitted.
• ELSS must only be supplied for use at sea and loaded onto an onboard system and is not to be provided for onshore
use by agents or representatives.  .  Onshore entry is to be made through the ERS website or by use of the offline
submission methods to be promulgated by the UK fisheries administrations, e.g. an emailed spreadsheet CSV
formatted file.  To this end the UK administrations will provide the Owner with the means for his agent(s) to logon
to the ERS website to view the vessel trip record to date and the logbook numbers used, to aid their completion of
the reports they wish to submit from their offices.

Glossary
Describes terms used in the document.
The title of a function is normally not
described. Please refer to the note below for
each function-title.
The term:
means:
Absolute braking distance
The distance between a train following another
train shall be equal to or greater than the braking
distance of the following train.
Acknowledge, Acknowledgement New data/situation that the driver has to accept
to avoid intervention.
Advisory information
Information indicated to the driver on the DMI to
assist him in driving the train.
Axle counter
A method of “train detection”.  Track mounted
equipment counts he number of axles entering and
leaving a track section at each extremity. A
calculation is performed to determine whether the
track section is “occupied” or clear.
Balise
Device used for intermittent transmission between
track and train and/or train and track.
Banking
An additional traction unit at the rear end of the
train, not coupled, supporting the train for moving
up a hill, leaving the train on top whilst running.
Block
A method of controlling the separation between
trains by dividing the line into sections with,
normally, no more than one train in each section.
The block can either be a fixed block or a  moving
block.
Braking curve
A speed-distance curve calculated from train and
infrastructure data and deceleration parameters of
the train.
Confirm, Confirmation
The driver’s approval/validation that new
data/information shall be taken into account by the
system.
ERTMS/ETCS FRS v 5.00
92
Continuous data transmission Track-to-train or train-to-track transmission can
take place continuously via long loop or radio. The
information is dedicated by a unique ETCS
identifier.
CTS
Centralized Train Signalling. movement authorities
and possibly static train profiles are calculated in
the CTS and transmitted to the train via ETCS.
Default value
Value stored in the ETCS trainborne equipment
and used if there is  no other value being available.
DMI
Driver Machine Interface. The trainborne device
indicating ETCS information to the driver and used
by the driver for operating ETCS.
Driving "on sight"
The driver has to drive at a speed he is able to stop
the train or the shunting movement respecting any
obstacle on the track that may violate his vehicle(s).
Dynamic train speed profile
The speed-distance curve which a train may follow
without violating the static train speed profile and
the end of movement authority. This curve
depends on the braking characteristics of the train
and the train length.
Emergency brake
As defined in UIC leaflet 541-03. All emergency
brake applications initiated by ETCS may be
released by the driver according to a national value
except in the case of applying to  train trip
End of movement authority
Location to which the train is permitted to proceed
and where target speed = zero.
Equipped line
Trackside ETCS equipment installed to provide Full
Supervision .
Exit signal
Main signal, intended for trains leaving a station.
Fixed block
A block in which the extremities of the block
sections are fixed. The signalling allows a train to
move from one block to the next, normally only
when the block ahead is clear.
Full service brake
As defined in UIC leaflet 541-03. May be released
by the driver at any time.
In advance of
B is said to be in advance of A if a train would pass
A before B in the direction of travel.
ERTMS/ETCS FRS v 5.00
93
Infill information
Data which is transmitted from track-to-train at
locations other than at main signals. Provides, for
example, the ability to inform a train that the signal
ahead has cleared.
In rear of
A is said to be in rear of B if a train would pass A
before B in the direction of travel.
Interlocking
Trackside safety system for trains running in
stations.
Intermittent transmission
Track-to-train or train-to-track transmission which
can only take place when the train passes the
information point (balise or short/medium loop or
radio area)
Intervention
Where ETCS takes control from the driver by
- cutting traction power (as an option)or
- applying the full service brake and cutting traction
power or
- applying the emergency brake and cutting traction
power.
Local Time
Universal Time Corrected +local offset
Loop
Device for data transmission between track and
train and/or train and track. May be a short loop, a
medium loop or a long loop.
Main signal
A fixed signal intended for train movements,
capable of showing a "danger" aspect and one or
more "proceed" aspects. In some cases main
signals at "danger" are valid also for shunt
movement.
Movement authority
Permission for a train to run to a specific location
within the constraints of the infrastructure.
Moving block
A block in which the extremities of the block
sections are continually adjusted according to the
position of the occupying train.
Multiple
Two or more traction units in service, mechanically
pneumatically and electrically coupled, which are
operated by one driver.

the route and locked as the route. The overlap
must not be released until the train has stopped.
Pantograph
Device for transmitting power from overhead wire
to the train.
Permissive signal
A signal aspect or a signal identification, which
enables a main signal to be passed at "danger"
under special conditions, without specific
permission from signalman.
Permitted speed
The speed limit at which a train is allowed to
proceed without ETCS warning and/or intervention.
Propelling
A train movement, in which the driver is not
situated in the leading vehicle.  When propelling
the operative cab is next to the train being
propelled and the master switch is in Forward.  A
train set can not propel itself (see reversing) but is
able to propel another trainset.
Railway management system Administrative data base outside the scope of
ETCS. From this data base ETCS may provide
information for train supervision as well as for
advisory purposes.
RBC
Radio Block Centre. A centralized safety unit to
establish and control train separation. Receives
location information from all trains and generates
movement authorities to all trains. May provide an
interface to interlocking systems for (partial) control
of interlocking and indications from interlocking.
Provides a train control possibility.
The ETCS data radio channel used is a safe data
transmission channel  not intended for spoken
communication.
ERTMS/ETCS FRS v 5.00
95
Reference point
Information point used for train location updating.

Relative braking distance
A train following another in less than absolute
braking distance of the following train.
Release speed
A speed value calculated by the ETCS trainborne
equipment to allow a train to approach the end of
its movement authority in a safe way. Needed for
intermittent transmission to enable the train to
approach a signal that has cleared in order to
reach the information point at the signal.
Reversing
A train movement, in which the driver is not
situated in the leading vehicle.  When reversing
the operative cab of a locomotive is not next to the
train being reversed.  The operative cab of a train
set will be an integral part of that train set.  In both
cases the master switch is in Reverse.

situated in the leading vehicle. Hauling forward the
master switch in the operative cab is in Forward for
this operation. Hauling reverse the master switch in
the operative cab is in Reverse for this operation.
Shunt propelling
A shunting movement, in which the driver is not
situated in the leading vehicle. See also propelling.
Shunting movement
When vehicles are moved without train data
available.
Shunting signal
A fixed signal intended for shunting movements. In
some cases Shunting signals at "danger" are valid
also for train movements.

Determination of a track section not occupied by
any railway vehicle. Determination is traditionally
based on track circuits or axle counters, but may
on ETCS equipped lines be replaced by train
location and train Integrity functions.
Track occupied
Track occupied by railway vehicle(s). Determination
is traditionally based on track circuits or axle
counters, but may on ETCS equipped lines be
replaced by train location and train integrity
functions. Because of the fail safe construction
track occupied could mean: track not determined
free.

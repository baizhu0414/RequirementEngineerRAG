1. Introduction
1.1 Goals and objectives
The central trading system (CTS) is to complete the trading of stock. It analyses the
instructions that enter the central trading system and divides them into several kinds of
instructions. System will make a match between them under specifically prescripts. Also
central trading system provides some interfaces to send messages to other modules.
1.2 System Context
The CTS is just a subsystem of the whole stock trading system (STS) system. There
are mainly six subsystems involved, stock account operation, financing account operation,
trade client serve, network message promulgating, centeral trading system and trading
system manage. Communications exist among these subsystems which complicates the
relationships between subsystems.
The CTS receive instructions from trade client serve. Then the CTS produce new
messages which to be sent to network message promulgating after deal with the
instructions from trade client serve. Also the system manager is authorization to access
the information in CTS.
1.3 Potential Users’ Specification
There are mainly two kinds of users. The CTS provides the terminal users easy
Operations that are confined to a series of mouse clicks and keyboard, which compared to
other systems are really much simplified. However, for another user, things are
different .the maintainers of this CTS must be familiar with java programming and the
socket. When the system crashes down, they can find the cause and fix it. When new
requirements should be supported, they can modify the program to make it fit.
As the instruction is frequently operated in CTS such as fetch, deal with, repeal and
so on, the CTS is heavily transferred. The program must take this into consideration. The
maintainers of CTS should have good strategies to overcome crash of the system when
overhead exceeds the capacity of it.
2. User Scenario
2.1 User Profiles
There are mainly five kinds of actors, which here consist of other related sub-systems,
involved with our Central Trading System. They are Transaction User Interface, Security

Account Management, Trading Management System, Trading Information Release.
2.2 User Scenarios Specification
2.2.1 Personal Opinion
Often, user-scenario is considered the same to use-case. They both can help our team
understand how system functions and features will be used by different classes of
end-users (actors). However, I prefer to understand it like this: a user scenario is a
particular environment within a specified use case. So, I will specify user-scenarios going
along with developing use cases in the next session.

The instructions first arrive at the instruction pretreatment modular which will judge
the validity of the instruction and freeze the fund and write the log files. Then the
instructions will go to the instructions manager modular. This modular will deal with all
the three kinds of instructions. Then it will send the results to the Trading client serve and
information releasing modular as well as keep a log file.
3.3 Level 2 DFD for the instruction pretreatment
Version 1.0
11
The instructions analysis will identify the kind of the instructions. Then it will deal
with the illegal instructions like the raising limit and freezing the fund in the Data Base.
In addition, it will keep log file about the instructions.
3.4 Level-2 DFD of the instructions manager
Version 1.0
12
In this level the three kinds of instructions will go to three different modules. The
query instruction will refer to the Data Base or the instructions list. The cancel instruction
will delete the instruction the instruction in the instructions list. And the trade instruction
will go to the trade manager to make a match in the instructions list.

7 Validation Criteria
7.1 Interface criteria
The central trading system has relation with three modules that are trading client
serve、trading manager system、information releasing module. These modules have
contact with CTS using the interface supplied by CTS.
7.1.1 Transaction User Interface
The Transaction User Interface has to input the instructions. The input instruction is
divided into three kinds: buy instruction, sell instruction and query instruction.
a) buy instruction
This instruction should have five parameters: user ID, stock ID, quantity,
respected price, timestamp.
b) sell instruction
This instruction should have five parameters: user ID, stock ID, quantity,
respected price, timestamp.
c) query instruction
This instruction can be divided into two kinds: user query instruction and
the stock query instruction. The user query instruction should have three
Version 1.0
17
parameters: user ID, query content, some restrict parameters. The stock query
instruction should has three parameters: stock ID，query content, some restrict
parameter。
7.1.2 Information Releasing Module
The information releasing module use the interface to find the price of the stocks.
The input should has two parameters including the stock name and the restrict
parameter.
7.1.3 Trading manager system
The trading manager system uses the interface to find the user’s trading instruction.
The input should has two parameters including the trading instruction type(buy or
sell),and the restrict parameter.
7.2 Function Criteria
The CTS deals with trading instruction, query instruction and some cancel
instruction. The functions are as follows:
1) instruction matching
When the client serve get a trading instruction, it will send the instruction to the
CTS to trade with other trading instructions. The process of the trading includes the
following two main principles: price first principle and the time first principle. If the
trading fails when these two principles have been applied, we should refer to another
principle. If the lowest buy price is higher than the highest sell price, then the CTS
will make a match of this trading.
2) rising andfalling limit
If the trading price is higher(lower) than the rising limit (falling limit), the CTS
will reject this trading instruction.
3) return the result
The CTS will return the result to the client serve for any trading instructions than
go into the CTS.
The trading states are divided into two kinds: totally finished and the partially
finished.
4) outdated instruction
If a instruction haven’t finished it’s trading in one day, then it will be removed
form the CTS for out of date.

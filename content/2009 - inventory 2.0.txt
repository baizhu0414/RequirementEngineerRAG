2. Overview
The Inventory Management System is an application designed to allow the Construction Junction staff to
create, maintain and view the contents and value of its inventory of items in a categorized way. It also
facilitates the process of receiving items into the Construction Junction inventory via the drop-off, pick-up
and deconstruction donation processes so that items can be traced from donation through sale. It also
integrates with the QuickBooks Point of Sale retail management software currently in use by Construction
Junction as well as the organization‟s website.

3.8. View Acquisitions
Acquisition records for Drop-Off, Pickup and Decon donations are created in the CRM system. Inventory
Management users should be able to view all past and current acquisitions. Receiving Associates use
this function to locate an expected acquisition when receiving a donation at the loading dock. Pickup and
Decon crews may also use this function to initiate the process of receiving items while in the truck, on
their way to the receiving dock.
Drop Off acquisitions are not typically pre-scheduled as Pick Up and Decon acquisitions except for those
submitted through the organizational website. As such, when a donor arrives with an unexpected drop off
donation, a new acquisition needs to be able to be created in the CRM system first, at either the customer
service desk or at the dock, before it can be viewed in the acquisitions screen.

3.9. Receive Acquisition
A donor in possession of a valid acquisition number can proceed to the receiving dock where the items to
be donated will be received and processed, and a donation receipt will be generated. Alternatively, a
donor may go directly to the receiving dock, in which case a new acquisition is created by the Receiving
Associate before items can be received and processed.
The screens used for the acquisition process should simplify and expedite the data entry process,
allowing the Receiving Associate to enter only the information needed to generate the donation receipt.
Additional attributes needed to complete the item information and effectively add the item to the inventory
can be added at a second step, after the receipt has been printed and the donor has been served. The
Receiving Associate can print temporary acquisition labels for items that require further processing.
Pick Up and Decon crews may also initiate the receiving process, entering as much detailed information
about the donated items as desired, and generating a donation receipt. They cannot, however, add items
to the inventory or complete the acquisition process. A Receiving Associate is required to review all the
acquisition information before those actions can take place.

4. High-Level Functional Requirements
This section contains high-level requirements for systems functions identified during the inception phase
as being medium and low priority items.
4.1. Medium Priority
4.1.1. Website Integration – The system should integrate with Construction Junction‟s
website and allow, in addition to capacity outlined in later sections, the ability for customers to
view and search CJ‟s inventory online. The item search can be done in two ways:
The user may „drill down‟ to a particular category using the hierarchical inventory view
displayed on the website.
The user may perform a search for items by keyword (basic search) and other parameters
such as price, date received and/or discount (advanced search).
The „Shop‟ page on CJ‟s website provides a starting concept of what the categorized inventory
search might look like as does the website at www.seconduse.com.
„Contact Us‟ and „Online Donation Form‟ website pages should integrate with Salesforce and
allow donors to upload images.
The system should also include the implementation of Salesforce.com Ideas on CJ‟s „Recycling &
Resources‟ webpage to allow for crowd sourcing the best recycling options for various materials
in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.
4.1.2. E-Blast Flagging – The ability to easily flag items for inclusion in e-Blast, both
while adding the item to the inventory and after it has been added to inventory (such as by
scanning the bar code). This also includes adding one or more photographs of the item to the
inventory which can be included in the e-Blast or other marketing material.
A „blastworthy‟ flag already exists on the item entry and update screens. That field can be used to
flag an item for inclusion on the next e-Blast.
When an item is flagged for e-Blast, the system should verify that a stocking location has been
set for the item.
The system should allow Construction Junction staff to view a list of all items that are currently
flagged as blastworthy that haven‟t yet been included in an e-Blast. The user can then select
which flagged items should be included on the next e-Blast.
The system should also provide an e-Blast preview screen that displays all items selected for that
week‟s e-Blast, and also all items that have been flagged but not selected.
A cart with a laptop, camera and bar code reader will be used by the Construction Junction staff
when looking for items in the sales floor that should be e-Blasted. That allows the user to quickly
locate an item in the inventory by scanning its tag, flag items that aren‟t yet flagged and enter
additional item information prior to the e-Blast.
The system should integrate with Vertical Response (or its future possible replacement, Exact
Target) for the e-Blast email notifications.
Inventory Management
Software Requirements Specification
Version 2.00
Confidential and Proprietary
Page 32 of 62
November 9th, 2009
The system should also allow Construction Junction staff to view a list of all items that were
included in previous week‟s e-Blast and that have been sold. The user can then select the items
that should be included in the „Great and Gone‟ section of the website. The system should also
allow the user to select any sold items, adding pictures as needed, to be included in the „Great
and Gone‟ section, even if they were not part of previous week‟s e-Blast.  „Great and Gone‟ items
should have a “Sold” overlay over their associated images.
Items should be able to be re-Blasted without affecting previous e-Blast versions.
4.1.3. e-Commerce Integration – Integration with the Construction Junction website to
allow for online purchases and auctions, automatically adding new items to the e-Commerce site
and updating the site when items are sold, either through the e-Commerce site or in the store.
Additionally, support inventory that is available only through the e-Commerce site and cannot be
purchased in the store.
The website should present an „Add to Cart‟ button on search results and item detail screens and
standard „View Shopping Cart‟ and checkout functionality as well as the option to „forward item to
a friend‟.
The system does not need to support shipping options. All items purchased have to be picked up
at the Construction Junction site.
Only items flagged as available for online purchase on the inventory system can be purchased
online. Those items are held in a separate area in the warehouse designated for online items and
can only be purchased online.
For items that are not available for online purchase the website should display a comment that
reads 'You can purchase this item over the phone or at Construction Junction'. When an item is
purchased over the phone it is physically moved to the SOLD items area in the warehouse, but
should remain on the website for an additional 15 days with “Sold” appearing across the item
name and image.
4.1.4. Membership Program – Implement a membership program that would make it
easier to track customer/donor activity.  Based on a membership card, linked to the
donor/customer contact in CRM and QuickBooks POS, where swiping or scanning the card
would quickly bring up the customers information, making the donation or purchasing process
faster (eliminating the need for Construction Junction staff to enter the name and demographic
information for repeat donors/customers). Once established, a membership card program could
be used for any number of uses, such as:
A membership rewards or frequent donor rewards program
Special “members only” promotions, coupons or discounts
Targeting marketing for program members
Once registered online, the system should allow Construction Junction staff to print out a member
card (possibly via QuickBooks POS) containing the member‟s name and unique member ID, in
both numeric and bar code format. The member card can be scanned by Construction Junction
staff to quickly identify the member when donating or purchasing items. The member‟s email
address and associated customer ID/barcode should uniquely identity the member in both
QuickBooks POS and in the CRM system.
The system should allow Construction Junction to reward customers for frequent donating by
giving them in-store credit that can be used when purchasing items.
Inventory Management
Software Requirements Specification
Version 2.00
Confidential and Proprietary
Page 33 of 62
November 9th, 2009
The „Reuse Reward‟ amount credited for each donated item should be kept separate from store
credit for returned merchandise and be calculated as follows:
For stock items, credited when the item is received, and calculated as 0.5% of the stock
item‟s pre-defined price.
For unique items, credited only the item is sold, and calculated as 1% of the price the
item was actually sold for.
The system should also provide reports that show all items a particular donor brought in and how
much those items were sold for.
QuickBooks POS should be aware of the current amount of credit accrued by a member so that it
can be used whenever the member wants to purchase an item. Users should be able to use their
accrued balance to buy gift certificates and give them to someone else.
The system should be able to print the donor‟s current credit amount on the donation receipt.
QuickBooks POS should also print a message on the sales and donation receipt informing
customers that they can earn rewards by donating to Construction Junction.
Additional membership benefits should include:
Signing up for CJ‟s weekly e-Blast (all users who sign up for the e-Blast are automatically
members and all users who sign up to be members automatically receive the weekly e-
Blast (unless they manually uncheck that option)).
Ability to manage online profile including status of e-Blast subscription, donation
addresses, view sales history, donation history and re-reprint donation receipts online.
Ability to have insight into the type of items scheduled for pickup by CJ
Automatic notification when accumulated credits reach a certain self-defined threshold.
Ability to create a public green business or service listing.
Ability to upload images and video of their reuse project(s)
Advance notification of new class offerings and upcoming events.
Easier purchasing of items offered online and automatic pre-registration for online
auctions.
Option to purchase CJ gift cards at a slightly discounted rate.
Bonus in store discounts on member‟s birthday.
Allows faster completion of online donation form and allows user to view and request
available slots in CJ‟s pickup schedule.
4.1.5. Customer Wish List – Provide users with the ability to notify Construction
Junction of items that they would like to purchase and be notified when/if those items become
available.  Customer wish lists would only be viewable by Construction Junction staff and will not
be publicly available.
Construction Junction website users should be able to select a particular item category in the
inventory (via an inventory or e-Blast view) and add it to their wish list. Users should also be able
to add to the wish list any of the categories for items returned as search results. Anytime a new
item is received into the inventory in that category, an automated notification is then sent to the
user.
The notification can be in multiple forms such as an email message, text message, voice blast,
Twitter or Facebook. That option is set by the user in his/her website account settings. That
means that in order to take advantage of the wish list functionality, the user must be registered as
a Construction Junction website member.
Inventory Management

November 9th, 2009
Customer Service representatives should also be able to add to a customer‟s wish list when
requested by him/her at the customer service desk or via email phone, etc..
Users should be able to view their current wish line online and remove entries from it.
Users should also be able to add to their wish lists the categories of items that have been sold
over the past 15 days. That means that once an item is sold, it should still be listed on the website
for a period of 15 days, and its listing should contain the „SOLD‟ word on it.
4.1.6. Pickup/Decon Logistics – This functionality has been implemented in large part
to date, including donation receipts and pick up forms, but additional required functionality
includes:
A system that will support scheduling and tracking Pickup and Decon jobs by providing
map views that can be filtered by various parameters including location, date range
(today, next week, next month, all, etc.) and donation type.
Map shows donations with truck icon that reflects portion of truck capacity consumed.
On hover over, mini page layout shows: date, portion of truck consumed, crew name,
appointment time, estimated value and donation description.
Automatic reminder emails to donors one day before a scheduled pickup is to occur as
well as automatic thank you emails once a donation acquisition has been completed.
4.1.7. Inventory Aging/Automatic Price Discount – Automatically decrease
price of inventory items by a set amount that have remained in the inventory for a set period of
time. For example, reducing the price by 10% each month that the item remains in inventory
The item entry and update screens should include a „Subject to Aging Discount‟ flag. The system
should use that flag to automatically generate discounts for items based on the amount of time
they have been in the inventory.
The discount should be calculated as a 10% discount for each month that the item has been in
the inventory, and the item label should display the discounted prices and their corresponding
date periods. The aging starts on the date when the item is assigned a price and is effectively
added to the inventory, and not when the item is received.
QuickBooks POS should apply the correct discount for the current date when an item is sold, and
the website should automatically display the correct discount for the current date (requires regular
data transfer).

Software Requirements Specification
Version 2.00
Confidential and Proprietary
Page 35 of 62
November 9th, 2009
4.1.8. On-site Storage – The ability to track those items purchased by customers but left
on-site for a maximum seven day period until the customer is able to return to pick up the
item(s).
The sold item should be able to be viewed in Salesforce and flagged as „stored on-site‟ with an
automatic „pick up date‟ calculated for seven days out.  Staff can print a sold tag that is affixed to
the sold item.
Automatic emails are sent to the customer as required pick-up dates approach and the status of
items is updated as they are picked up.
Tasks are generated for staff to return overdue items to the sales floor and apply the appropriate
store credit to customer accounts for items that have not been picked up within the allotted
seven day period.  This puts the item back into inventory and affects customer store credit
accounts.
4.1.9. Overstock Pricing – The ability to set thresholds for specific items or categories
that will indicate that there are too many or too little of these items in the inventory and allow the
prices to be adjusted for the over or under stock condition.
The system must allow a threshold quantity to be set at any level (department or category) in the
inventory. Once that threshold is reached for a department or category, the corresponding matrix
cell should change to a different color that indicates the overstock condition. Also, the current
quantity on hand and the threshold value for the item‟s department or category should be
displayed on the item entry and update screens. This information should also be displayed on a
different color or layout when the threshold is reached.
The system should still allow items to be received for a department or category that is
overstocked, but Construction Junction staff may decide to turn down those items at the receiving
dock.
The system should also provide a report that shows currently overstock departments and
categories.
Based on the overstock report Construction Junction staff may decide to put the entire category
on sale for a period of time, or until the category is no longer overstocked. As the discount is only
temporary, the item prices should not be changed in the Inventory. However, the price discount
should be automatically applied on purchases via QuickBooks POS, and should also be visible on
the website.
4.2. Low Priority
4.2.1. Mobile Handheld Units – The ability to scan items on the store floor and update
the inventory item from a small handheld unit or tablet PC. Additionally, handheld/tablet units
that can be used by Pickup and Decon crews on worksites.
The mobile units should allow that all inventory screens can be displayed and used in the same
fashion as in the fixed workstations. This eliminates the need for designing a second set of
screens to be used on mobile units with limited display capabilities.

November 9th, 2009
4.2.2. Inventory Item Story/History – The ability to add a history or back story for
items with particularly unique or significant origins and share this store with customers on the
website and in the store.
The Inventory Item entry screen already provides a comments/history text field that can be used
for the purpose described.
In addition to that, the system should be able to generate and print signage containing the item
history, back story information and other item details. Ideally, the system would provide a few pre-
defined formats for signage that can be chosen from.
4.2.3. Calculate Shipping Weight – Extend the Pickup/Decon Logistics system to
calculate donation size/truck capacity.
The described functionality is being implemented as part of the CRM project.
In addition, the Inventory Management System needs to store item weight information and
generate reports that indicate the total weight received, sold and diverted from landfills.
When the actual item weight is not indicated, the system should use a pre-set average weight for
the item category.
The system should also display the actual weight average for the category on the category
configuration screen, and also the number of items used when calculating that average. The
inventory administrator can then decide whether to configure the category to use the actual
average weight or a pre-set average weight, which would be set manually.
4.2.4. Donor Ranking/Feedback – Allow Construction Junction staff to enter
information on Donors related to details of the donors location, ease of working with the donor,
and any additional information that may be helpful for future donations.
The described functionality, which ranks the donor in terms of ease of working with, is being
implemented as part of the CRM project.
Construction Junction would also like to be able to generate the following donor statistics, which
could be implemented in the form of reports:
Number/value/volume of donations per donor
Fastest selling donations / time to sell per donor
Value retention of items (sold x estimated price) per donor
Overall donor rating

5. Supplementary Requirements
This section outlines requirements that are not covered within the use cases and other preceding high-
level requirements sections. It documents non-functional requirements of the system that capture quality
attributes, implementation approach, compatibility concerns, deployment and more.
5.1. Usability
The application is expected to operate via touch screen user interfaces, and take advantage of that
technology to be as fast, efficient, intuitive, and flexible as possible while also minimizing the potential for
errors and duplications. It should minimize the use of keyboard and mouse when processing
acquisitions, and should allow acquisitions to be completed with few clicks and page switches.
5.2. Availability
For internal users:
Donation/acquisition processing - The system must be available during normal Construction
Junction operating hours.
Sales processing - The system must be available during normal Construction Junction operating
hours.

accommodate inventory management operations.
For external users - The system must be available beyond normal operating hours to accommodate
website use – Inventory listing, wish list management and online purchases.
5.3. Reliability
There are no reliability requirements.
5.4. Security
Access to the application by the Construction Junction staff must require user login. Access to application
screens and functions is granted or denied based on the profile and role of the currently logged in user,
as detailed in the preceding use-case requirements. The system should record changes to application
entities in the form of „created user/time‟, „modified user/time‟ fields. The system should also record
information about various sensitive inventory management operations such as deleting items and
changing the price of items.
5.5. Performance
The functionality provided by the Inventory Management System will be critical to the normal operation of
the Construction Junction business. As such, the system should perform with consistently and predictably
low response times in order not to impact the performance or the timely execution of the various tasks
that need to be conducted by the Construction Junction staff.
5.6. Interfaces

data to migrate.
Construction Junction has acquired CRM Fusion products including Demand Tools, People Import and
Dupe Blocker to assist with these efforts.
5.9. Disaster Recovery, Backups, and Business Continuity Plan
As the Inventory Management System does not replace any existing legacy system, Construction
Junction doesn‟t currently have documented procedures for disaster recovery, backups and business
continuity for its inventory operations. Appropriate procedures will need to be developed and documented
for the chosen implementation platform. That should include:
Backups - How will backups be done, what data the backups are to include, where the backup media
will be stored, and for how long that media will be maintained.
Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan - How the system will be recovered, the timeframe
for recovery, and the fallback procedures to allow business to continue including offline capabilities.

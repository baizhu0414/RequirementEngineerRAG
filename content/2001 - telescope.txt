Software Requirements Specification
1.SCOPE
This document defines the software requirements for the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT) Control Processor (XCP)
Flight Software (FSW).  This document is a Level 4 specification as defined in document GSFC-410.4-SPEC-0004,
Swift Missions Requirements Document.
1.1System Overview
The Swift observatory is the next in a series of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) medium-
class explorer (MIDEX) satellites and is the first-of-its-kind observatory for multi-wavelength transient astronomy.
The goal of the Swift mission is to determine the origin of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and to exploit data from these
bursts to probe the early universe.  Swift instrumentation will exploit newly discovered GRB afterglow
characteristics to make a comprehensive study of approximately 1000 bursts over its planned three-year mission.
Swift will determine the origin of GRBs, reveal how GRB blast waves interact with surroundings, and identify
different classes of bursts and associated physical processes.  To accomplish these mission goals, Swift employs
three semi-autonomous science instruments.  The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) is a wide-angle x-ray telescope that
detects GRBs.  On detection, the spacecraft slews in the direction of the GRB, bringing it into the view of two
narrow-field telescopes for higher-resolution multi-wavelength observation. The narrow-field telescopes are the
X-Ray Telescope (XRT), and the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT).
The XRT is a sensitive, autonomous X-ray Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) imaging spectrometer designed to
measure the flux, spectrum, and light curve of GRBs and afterglow over a wide dynamic range covering more than
seven orders of magnitude in flux.  It will refine the BAT positions (~1-4' uncertainty) to 2.5" within 5 seconds of
target acquisition for typical bursts, allowing ground-based optical telescopes to begin immediate spectroscopic
observations of the afterglow.
The XRT will reuse some components from the following previous projects: Cosmic Unresolved Background
Instrument using CCDs (CUBIC), Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE), Joint
European X-Ray Telescope (JET-X), and the X-Ray Multi-Mirror (XMM) satellite.
The XRT electronics is split into two parts: the XRT Electronics Package (XEP), and the Camera Head.
1.1.1XRT Electronics Package (XEP)
The XEP is mounted on the Spacecraft (S/C) and is comprised of:
• A VERSAmodule European (VME) enclosure with two separate Faraday shielded compartments for
separate digital and analog sections
• A split backplane for separate digital and analog sections
• A low voltage power supply with fixed voltage outputs
• A Lockheed-Martin Federal Systems (LMFS) single board computer using the RAD6000 microprocessor
• The Communication board which has a Dual Redundant MIL-STD-1553 (1553) interface, a Real Time
Clock (RTC), a Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) to interface to the Telescope
Alignment Monitor (TAM), and a CCD data buffer
• A Relay board which has relays to control the heaters, TAM power, camera door High-Output Paraffin
(HOP) actuators, and the camera pressure relief valve HOP actuator.  The Relay board also has the Digital-
to-Analog Converters (DACs) for controlling the CCD voltages.
• The Sequencer board which uses an AD21020 microprocessor to generate the CCD clock waveforms
• The Housekeeping board that reads voltages, temperatures, and pressure.
• The Clock board that drives the CCD’s clock and bias voltage inputs.
• The Signal Chain board that processes the CCD’s analog video output and converts it to a digital bit stream.
The Signal Chain board is dual redundant.
• A Thermo-Electric Cooler (TEC) power supply with a variable voltage output

• The Engineering Units (EU) will also have an Ethernet board for software development, but the Flight Units
(FU) will not.
A one-meter maximum length cable electrically connects the XEP and Camera Head.  The XRT Interface Control
Document (Pennsylvania State University [PSU] document # XRT-PSU-018) describes the interface between these
two components.

1.1.2Camera Head
The major component of the XRT's electronics is the CCD camera.  The CCD camera collects science data in the
form of images, light curves, photon-counts, and spectral data.  The CCD camera has three main modes of operation
and up to sixty-four modes total.
The Camera Head is mounted on the telescope tube and is comprised of a CCD and two video preamplifiers.
The CCD itself has an image section, a store section, and two readout registers with video outputs. There are four
synchronized three-phase clocks that shift the pixel rows in the image and store sections and shift the individual
pixels in the two readout registers.  The Clock Sequencer in the XEP generates these clocks.  Each readout register
has five guard pixels at the output side, and the readout register will not be operated in the split mode; therefore, both
readout registers will be clocked in the same direction transferring all of the pixels to one, but not both, of the video

outputs. Since the readout registers are comprised of split-pixels, the readout registers have to be clocked twice
(double-clocked) to shift out one pixel.  The readout registers will be double-clocked an extra 30 times (overclocks)
to produce an output row length of 640 pixels.  The clocking of an empty output register produces overclocked
pixels that are used to determine system noise information.  To transfer an image from the Image Section to the Store
Section, the Image Section and Store Section three-phase clocks must be clocked simultaneously 602 times.  The
Clock Sequencer can be programmed with up to 64 waveform patterns which corresponds to the 64 modes of
operation previously mentioned.

1.1.3Thermo-Electric Cooler(TEC)
The CCD is cooled by a TEC.  The CCD's temperature is closed-loop controlled by the FSW.  Telecommands will
control the temperature setpoint, the ramp rate, and the mode — open or closed loop.  A digital potentiometer with
100 wiper tap points will control the temperature setpoint.  Two digital logic signals will control the wiper position:
the up/down input and the clock input.
1.1.4Power
The XRT is powered by the S/C by two 28VDC power buses.  They are the Operational Power Bus (OPB) and the
Survival Power Bus (SPB).  During normal operation, both buses are on.  If the XRT fails to communicate to the
S/C, the S/C will turn off the XRT’s OPB, thereby deactivating the XEP.  The hardware-reset function is exercised

April 23, 2001    Rev. 2 Chg. 0
Page 3
Southwest Research Institute
XRT Control Processor
Software Requirements Specification
by cycling the OPB off then back on.  The SPB supplies power to heaters that prevent the XRT from being damaged
by low temperatures.  The S/C may switch off the SPB, but it will only do this in an emergency condition.  The OPB
is dual redundant, and the SPB is single string.
1.1.5Communications Network
The XRT communicates to the S/C via a dual redundant MIL-STD-1553B serial interface.  Data transmitted to the S/
C from the XRT and commands received by the XRT from the S/C are formatted into "packets" within "frames" in
accordance with the Swift 1553 Bus Protocol Interface Control Document (Spectrum Astro document # 1143-EI-
S19121).  The BAT, UVOT, XRT, two Star Trackers, and the S/C are all networked together on the 1553 bus.
1.1.6Real Time Clock (RTC)
A local copy of the spacecraft clock is maintained and is used to timestamp the data packets, which are formatted as
Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Source Packets.  To synchronize the clocks in the
instruments with the clock in the S/C the S/C provides an At-The-Tone-The-Time-Will-Be message, delivered via
the 1553 interface, and an RS422, One-Pulse-Per-Second (1PPS), hardwired signal that is the "Tone."
1.1.7Telescope Alignment Monitor (TAM)
The XRT's tube has uses a device called the Telescope Alignment Monitor (TAM) to measure the change in
mechanical alignment of the XRT's tube.  The TAM consists of a point source of light that is reflected by mirrors
across the length of the telescope tube to a CCD camera.  The change in the telescope's alignment is proportional to
the change in the position of the point source of light shining on the CCD's pixel array.  To obtain a resolution better
than the pixel size, a centroid algorithm will be utilized.  The TAM receives power from the XEP and delivers image
data through an RS-422 serial interface.  The TAM power can be turned on or off by a telecommand.
1.1.8Doors and Sun Shutter
The XRT has two doors: a telescope tube door and a camera door.  The telescope tube door is controlled by the S/C.
The camera door is controlled by circuitry in the XEP.  Once opened, the camera door cannot be closed; therefore, it
is important that the door is not inadvertently opened.
The Sun Shutter is powered by the SPB and has its own solar panel for backup power.  It is automatically opened
and closed by a photosensor but can be overridden by a telecommand.
1.1.9Heaters
The telescope tube has 36 heater groups.  Each heater group is closed-loop controlled by the FSW with the
temperature set point and hysteresis controlled by a telecommand.  These controllers are simple on-off type with
hysteresis.
The Mirror Baffle has three heater groups: Survival, Control 1, and Control 2.  The Survival Heaters are powered
and controlled by the Spacecraft Bus.  The Control Heaters are closed-loop controlled by the FSW with a
temperature set point controlled by a telecommand.  The Control Heaters will be driven by solid state relays to allow
for the numerous on-off cycles that will be required to regulate the temperature.  The XRT Thermal Design
Specification (PSU document # XRT-PSU-012) describes the heaters in greater detail.
1.1.10Housekeeping
The XRT monitors several items and reports them as Housekeeping (HK) telemetry.  Numbers in parenthesis
indicate how many of each housekeeping item are being monitored.  The housekeeping items are:
• CCD bias voltages (10)
• CCD clock voltages (16)

4.OVERVIEW
This section provides an overview of the FSW including a system context, operational concepts, goals and
constraints, and a list of the computer software components (CSCs) which comprise the FSW.  Detailed functional,
performance, error recovery, and interface requirements for the identified CSCs are provided in Appendix A.
4.1System Context
From a system (observatory) perspective, the FSW interfaces with the Spacecraft Control Unit (SCU) via the MIL-
STD-1553B bus and the one pulse per second (1PPS) interface.  The interfaces of the FSW in this context are
illustrated in the following figure.

Figure 4.  Flight Software Context Diagram – External Interfaces
From a XCP hardware interface perspective, the FSW executes on the XCP, stores and retrieves data from XCP
Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM), and communicates with the Spacecraft using
the MIL-STD-1553B Bus.  The MIL-STD-1553B and Camera Head Interfaces are contained on the XRT
Communications Module (XCM).  The interfaces of the FSW in this context are illustrated in the following figure.

4.2Operational Concepts
The following sections describe the operational concepts of the FSW, including its functions, interfaces, performance
characteristics, error detection, reporting and recovery mechanisms, and ground systems concepts.
4.2.1Functions
The FSW has the following primary functions:
• Process science data from the camera and relay it to the Spacecraft Control Unit (SCU) in the form of CCSDS
Source Packets.
• Receive commands from the SCU that establish the current instrument state and camera mode.
• Transmit detailed housekeeping data to the SCU in the form of CCSDS Source Packets.
• Receive a time message from the SCU and synchronize the XCP local copy of the spacecraft clock.
• Control the heaters on the telescope tube and on the thermal baffles.
• Read the TAM.
4.2.2Observation Sequence
The XRT supports three different, but very similar, observation sequences.  The three observation types are:
• Automatic
• Preplanned
• Target of Opportunity
Figure 6 and Figure 7 show a detailed flowchart for the observation types.  The sequence shown in the figures
assumes the software is in automatic mode and not presently engaged in performing an observation.  The sequence
starts when a SISCATTITUDE message is received with the IS_SETTLED indication set tofalse.  The message also
indicates IS_IN_10_ARCMIN, which is true when the S/C is within ten arc minutes of the target position.  When the
distance remaining to slew is greater than ten arc minutes, the S/C begins the first of up to three activities that
precede an observation.  Each activity is initiated when the distance remaining is greater than ten arc minutes and the
previous activity is complete.  The pre-observation activities are:
• Calculate row bias map
• Calculate image bias map
• Collect raw data image

Figure 8.  Observing Sequence (Part 3)
The row bias map is maintained by the system so that it does not have to be recalculated prior to each observation;
however, recalculation is preferred to provide the best results.  One frame is acquired for the row bias map. Once the
frame has been acquired, the software recalculates and stores the updated row bias map.  Next, the software
recalculates the image bias map, if more than ten arc minutes remain to the target location. The software accumulates
3-6 frames for the recalculation of the row bias map.  Otherwise, the existing image bias map is reused. Finally, if the
acquire raw data image flag is true and the distance to the target location is more than ten arc minutes, then the
software acquires a single raw data image which is saved for later download to the ground.
At this point, the S/C has come to within ten arc minutes of the target or the observation preliminary activities are
complete, and the software switches to the fast timing mode.  When the SISCATTITUDE message indicates that the
S/C is settled, the software starts the main portion of the observation sequence.
The software now acquires a frame of data and begins counting the pixels above a detection threshold.  To be
considered of interest, this count of pixels must exceed a programmable threshold.  If the count does not exceed the
threshold, then another image is acquired and summed with the first image.  This new image is subjected to the pixel
count.  This process continues until the count threshold is met or the timeout period is exceeded.  If the timeout is
exceeded, an “XRT Centroid Error” message is transmitted to UVOT and to the ground (via TDRSS).  Otherwise,

when the source is detected, the software performs a centroid calculation on the image.  If the centroid calculation
fails, an “XRT Centroid Error” message is sent; otherwise, an “XRT Position” message is sent.
Next, the software enters the fast timing mode.  In this mode, the CCD reports a single value representing the entire
image.  The CCD reports one pixel every 16 µsec, or approximately 60,000 pixels/sec.  The software remains in this
mode while the lit pixel rate exceeds 40 cps.  Once the count falls below 40 cps, the software switches to normal
timing mode.  In this mode, the CCD reports one row every 5 msec.  Each row report sums up the CCD columns.
This method is used until the rate drops below 2 cps.  At this point, the software switches to photon counting mode.
In this mode, the entire image is collected and scanned for lit pixels.  The update rate is approximately once every
2.5 sec.  The observation sequence ends when the target is occulted and the S/C slews to a new target.
Preplanned observations differ from automatic ones in that the “XRT Position” message is not used.  Processing is
otherwise similar.  The target of opportunity observations are treated like preplanned observations from an
operational point of view of the software.

4.2.3Interfaces and Performance
Estimates of the maximum amount of memory required to buffer an observation were computed according to the
following analyses.
Table 3 shows the science telemetry data rates expected for a burst whose x-ray emission has dropped below about 3
Crabs within 30 seconds.  Since in this case it is assumed that it takes the S/C 50 seconds to slew to the source, the
flux is already at or below 4000 cps by the time the S/C has slewed to the target and generated an XRT Position and
an XRT image report.  At this flux, the XRT is generating science telemetry at a rate of just over 100kbps, but only
for about 50 seconds.  Within 30 minutes, the maximum length of an observation before the target is occulted, the
data rate has dropped to less than 700bps.  During such an observation the XRT would generate about 2.7MB of
data, for an average rate of about 12kbps.

Table 4 shows the expected data that would be generated by the XRT if it could observe the burst described above

whatever time it was not observing the burst, it would be observing the afterglows of bursts a day or more old, at
expected data rates of less than 700bps, or about the minimum data rate of the continuous observation of the new
burst.  Hence, the data rate of the continuous, 24-hour observation of a new burst represents the maximum data rate
expected for the XRT.  Under this scenario, the XRT would generate about 10MB of data per day, for an average
rate of about 1kbps, which is well within the 3.9kbps average rate allocated to the XRT for science telemetry.
Hence, under these conditions, if the amount of memory allocated for observation buffers exceeds 10MB, the XRT
should easily be able to meet its allocated science telemetry rate.

4.2.4Error Detection, Reporting and Recovery
The following sections summarize the error handling, reporting and recovery mechanisms of the XCP.
4.2.4.1Software Configuration Integrity
The XCP maintains primary and alternate FSW configurations in EEPROM.  The primary FSW configuration in
EEPROM is software locked to be read-only.  The primary FSW provides MIL-STD-1553B communications with
the SCU provided there are no failures.  The XCP bootstrap software autonomously switches to the alternate FSW
configuration in the event the primary configuration fails to boot.
Problems with the FSW that are identified on-orbit can be corrected by patch or by a complete software reload.  The
FSW contains an EEPROM-resident file system on which an object file containing a software patch can be loaded.
This object file can then be dynamically loaded and linked into the active FSW.  Alternatively, a complete software

XRT Control Processor
Software Requirements Specification
build can be loaded to the alternate FSW location in EEPROM and the XCP commanded to boot the alternate
configuration rather than the primary.
4.2.4.2Memory Error Detection and Correction
The processor board includes the EEPROM that holds the FSW, including the bootstrap and EEPROM File System
(EEFS), and the Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) that is used for program and data memory.  The
EEPROM includes a section that contains the bootstrap.  This section of the EEPROM is software write locked prior
to flight and includes a checksum that is compared against the stored data as part of the Built-In Tests (BIT) that are
executed on system startup.  The DRAM includes Error Detecting and Correcting (EDAC) memory.  This facility
stores redundant information in parallel with each memory word.  Whenever a memory word is read, the EDAC is
checked.  The EDAC can detect and correct single bit errors.  The EDAC can detect double bit errors.  Both events
cause an interrupt, and the software logs information about the error including the affected address and incrementing
the EDAC error count.  Multiple bit errors (two or more) cause the software to reset the processor by discontinuing
strobing of the watchdog timer, which causes the watchdog timer to reset the board when it times out.
A low priority software task called the Memory Scrubber runs when no other tasks are executing.  This task steps
through DRAM and reads each location.  When a word is read that contains a single-bit error, this routine rewrites it
to correct the problem, and the problem is logged to EEPROM through the interrupt mechanism.  The scrubbing
process seeks to repair single bit errors before they become uncorrectable multiple bit errors.  Multiple bit errors
uncovered by the scrubber result in a reset, even if the memory was not currently in use for processing by the FSW.
4.2.4.3Error Reporting
Errors are reported in XCP housekeeping telemetry. If an unrecoverable error occurs (such as an uncorrectable
memory error), the XCP will reboot via watchdog timer.  Detectable exceptions that cause a watchdog reboot are
recorded to EEPROM.
4.2.4.4Keep Alive Messaging
A heartbeat message from XRT to the SCU serves to indicate “aliveness” of the XRT Instrument to the Spacecraft.
4.2.5Ground Systems
Ground systems are required for the following purposes:
• Low-level driver integration and testing,
• XCP process integration and verification testing,
• Control and monitoring of XRT on orbit, and
• Operational display of downlinked data.
Low-level driver integration and testing is accomplished using a XCP-resident test application which exercises the
hardware interfaces via actual flight software drivers.  A Ground Support Equipment (GSE)-resident application
communicates with the XCP-resident test application over an RS-232 port which is unused on flight.  The GSE-
resident application commands the XCP-resident application to output or receive data on a particular hardware
interface.  The GSE has a direct connection to each hardware interface, and stimulates or measures the interface in
accordance with the command sent to the XCP.  Because the RS-232 port is not used on flight, each interface can be
tested without interfering with the command-and-response communication between the XCP and GSE resident
applications.
Simulators are used to facilitate integration and verification of the FSW.  To contain costs and smooth integration,
the external interfaces to the simulators used for integration testing and verification of the FSW are the same as the
ground system interfaces in the Science Mission Operations Center (SMOC).  This approach allows, at the

conceptual level, software and displays built for the display of data during simulated tests, to be reused for the
operational display of downlinked data without modification.
4.3Constraints
Certain constraints are imposed upon the specification and design of the FSW and are derived from upper-level
specifications and known system design constraints.  These constraints are listed in Table 5, along with the
implications of the constraint.

The TDRSS downlink bandwidth is limited

Malindi ground contacts are limited to
about 7 ground contacts per day (or less)
of 7-10 minutes each.  This is based on a
96-minute orbital period.
The design of the FSW must avoid any time-
consuming setup or configuration as part of its
nominal operation.  This may also have implications
for the way in which large software loads are
structured.

C3
The interface with the S/C provides that
real-time HK packets be limited to 230
bytes or less.  Instrument HK is placed
into the last 230 bytes of the regular S/C
RT HK frame.
The FSW design must structure its HK packets such
that the 230-byte constraint is not violated.  In
addition, the HK rate should be optimized to help
ensure that a HK packet can reasonably appear in
the S/C frame at an acceptable rate.  It is not clear
whether this also has implication to memory dumps.
The FSW may have to provide for small dump
packets if going down the RT link, and larger ones if
going to the Solid State Recorder (SSR).

The S/C does not reassemble segmented
packets and the Integrated Test and
Operations System (ITOS) ground system
is not currently capable of reassembling
segmented packets.
Any packet that must be processed by ITOS should
not be segmented.  Based on a meeting with Mike
Rackley on 08/30/00, ITOS will be upgraded to
reassemble packets, but it is not yet known when
this capability will be implemented.  This may also
have impact on memory dump packets.

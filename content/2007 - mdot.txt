INTRODUCTION
This document applies to the Michigan Department of Transportation’s
(MDOT’s) Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII) Data Use Analysis and
Processing (DUAP) System.
1.1 Document Identification
The document control number for this document is contained in the document
footer and the file name for the electronic rendition of the document is recorded in
the table of contents for the document.
1.2 Document Purpose
The purpose of this requirements specification is to provide a repository for the
requirements governing the design of MDOT’s VII DUAP System. These
requirements will form the basis for the design verification and validation of each
version of the system.
A system requirements specification states what must be accomplished to fulfill
the vision described in a concept of operations (ConOps). It does not state how it
is to be accomplished. This document describes each requirement and the basis
for inclusion of that requirement. The intended audience includes decision
makers, stakeholders, designers, and testers.
This document may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the system
requirements, including changes reflected in subsequent versions of the system.
1.3 System Scope
A strategy is laid out in the Michigan Department of Transportation Vehicle-
Infrastructure Integration Strategic and Business Plan that focuses on partnering,
developing, and deploying a VII infrastructure and test beds; increasing safety and
mobility; improving asset management; developing outreach programs to better
expose others to VII in Michigan; justifying the need for VII; and determining
creative investment funding venues for VII activities.
Within this context, the DUAP project will investigate and evaluate the utility of
VII data and its integration with other transportation agency sources in enhancing
safety, increasing mobility, and improving asset management. Tasks within
DUAP will identify uses for the VII data, develop algorithms to use and process
the VII data, develop prototype applications and data management software, and
evaluate the utility of the processed data for MDOT and its partners. Data
processing will require acquisition from a variety of sources, standardization and
integration, storage, synthesis for particular applications, and dissemination.
1.4 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
This section provides a general overview of the system and describes the general
factors that affect the system and its requirements. This section does not state
specific requirements, but instead is intended to make the requirements easier to
understand by giving them context.
2.1 Product Perspective
DUAP is a research program to determine how new VII data impacts safety,
traffic operations and management, asset management, winter operations, and
transportation planning. The program is focused on demonstration and assessment
of data transformation and management, and DUAP system development is a
means to that end. From a systems engineering functional viewpoint, the DUAP
system has four high-level capabilities:
• Collecting data
• Consolidating the collected information
• Converting data into information needed by transportation agencies
• Communicating the unified information to various agencies and the public
The DUAP system itself will be a prototype—completely functional for the
desired demonstrations, but not necessarily intended for operational use.
When describing a system, there are many ways to represent what the system will
do and how it will be implemented. Each representation has its own strengths and
limitations, but all are intended to create understanding of the system’s
boundaries, components, and interactions. Each representation has its own set of
basic units and interactions. One or more of these representations taken together
describe the system architecture.
Systems similar to the DUAP system are frequently and effectively represented as
sets of interacting services. Each service has one or more interfaces by which the
services interact. This representation is a very natural way of approaching a
potentially complex system with a basic repeatable model.
A representation based on services and interfaces inherently leads to a flexible,
scalable, and maintainable design. With well-defined interfaces, it is possible to
improve the functions of the system by adding services that conform to the
interfaces, but provide new operations. Services do not unnecessarily constrain
the physical and computational hardware to which they might be deployed. It is
possible to scale the system by adding hardware to support the processing needs
of new services as they are developed and deployed. Maintainability can be
preserved by being able to update both hardware and software components while
the system is running.
A DUAP system based on a service-oriented architecture will then be flexible,
scalable, and maintainable. It will be capable of handling large amounts of
continuously streaming data. It will support current and future MDOT missions
and goals.

VII Data Use Analysis and Processing
System Requirements Specification
Figure 1 is a simple (but abstract) representation of the DUAP system as a set of
services. As shown in the figure, the basic services provided by DUAP are input,
dynamic data, computational, persistent data, output, presentation, and
administrative. These basic services are common to all information systems, but
will have specific implementations for DUAP to assure that it meets the needs
described earlier in the ConOps.
Figure 1 – DUAP System Services
2.2 Product Functions
2.2.1 Input Services
The input services of the DUAP system will
• receive probe data from individual vehicles;
• receive traffic information from Advanced Traffic Management Systems
(ATMS) throughout the state;
• receive weather information from several sources; and
• receive traveler information from Advanced Traveler Information Systems
(ATIS) throughout the state, as well as other governmental and
commercial sources.
The VII Proof of Concept (POC) input service, for example, will use the X-031
Probe Data Service interface as described by the VII Network User to Service
Delivery Node (SDN) Subsystem document. DUAP data input services will send
a subscription request to the Probe Data Service, to be fulfilled within the VII
network. As infrastructure data are collected from the vehicles by the network, the
network feeds the data continuously to the subscribed DUAP services. (U.S.
Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. 2006.)

VII Data Use Analysis and Processing
System Requirements Specification
Data available to input services will vary among sources. In the case of the VII
POC input service, for example, data expected to be available would include
vehicle location, speed, direction of travel, acceleration, brake status, wheel angle,
steering wheel position, and headlamp status. Weather-related observations that
could be obtained from vehicle sensors might consist of ambient air temperature,
air pressure, sun sensor, and fog light status.
Input services will also receive speed, volume, and occupancy data from ATMS
throughout the state. The Michigan Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITS)
Center ATMS, for example, will have its own input service for collecting speed,
volume, and occupancy, and may also obtain event descriptions and messages
posted on changeable message signs/dynamic message signs (CMS/DMS).
2.2.2 Dynamic Data Services
The dynamic data services are a caching service intended to store DUAP data for
fast access over a relatively short duration. For example, probe vehicle data is
available from the VII SDN only long enough to fulfill the registered subscription
data distribution needs. The DUAP system must be able to cache the data after
input such that it remains available for downstream processing.
2.2.3 Persistent Data Services
Persistent data services provide longer-term storage within DUAP of both data
collected by input services and metadata needed by DUAP services to sustain
their operations. Archive services will store data from the dynamic data services
to support future data analysis and management needs. Metadata services manage
data needed by other DUAP services to
• create a context for the probe vehicle, traffic, and weather data, and
• describe the operation and formatting of the input, computational, output,
and presentation services.
2.2.4 Computational Services
The purpose of the DUAP system’s computational services is to apply logical
algorithms to incoming vehicle and traffic observations in order to transform
those observations into data that is directly applicable to transportation
management and operations processes. Computational services will operate on the
dynamic and persistent data to perform analysis functions that derive new and
useful information about what is occurring within the public infrastructure.
Derived information can then be operated upon by still other services for further
analysis.
Many computational services are possible. A list of immediately useful
algorithms includes:
• Incident Detection and Location
• Queue Length
• Travel Time
• Segment Aggregation

VII Data Use Analysis and Processing
System Requirements Specification
• Weather Condition
• Road/Bridge Condition
• Pothole Locator
• Data Quality Checking
2.2.5 Output Services
Output services subscribe to analyzed data and format it for use by other services
both within the DUAP system and external to it. For example, SAE J2354 XML
formatted data can be produced as data output to be used as data input to other
systems or ATIS that enhance public safety and provide access to the managed
infrastructure.
Data output services also format analyzed data for use by presentation services.
This could be as simple as structuring data for presentation as a report on a DUAP
Web page. It could also build informative messages to be sent to VII-participating
vehicles. This interaction could be achieved using the X-032 interface to the
Advisory Message Distribution Service as described in the VII National System
Specification.
2.2.6 Presentation Services
Presentation Services support human interpretation of DUAP data. Due to the
inherent flexibility in modular service implementation, presentation services—and
the data output services that support those presentation services—can be added to
the system as needed.
For example, a traveler information presentation service might be expected to
provide information on incidents and travel times through a Web page.
Computational services—incident detection travel time calculation, and incident
status monitoring, for example—would generate the data, and an output service
would package the data. A presentation service, however, would create the user
interface. Similarly, presentation services for maintenance support systems could
be deployed to generate pavement segment maintenance priority lists, immediate
maintenance alerts, and estimated segment roadway life expectancy from data
created by other computational services.
2.2.7 Administrative Services
Administrative services will exist within the DUAP system to configure other
services. Essentially, administrative services fulfill the role of “meta-services.”
These services will be used to organize the sequence of execution for any of the
other services, view logging information, and to change the operating modes of
the system.

2.3 User Characteristics
2.3.1 MDOT Organizational Structure
The Director of the Michigan Department of Transportation is appointed by the
Governor. The Executive Bureau also includes a Chief Deputy Director, Chief
Administrative Officer, and Chief Operations Officer.
The Michigan State Transportation Commission is the policy-making body for all
state transportation programs. The Commission consists of a six-member bi-
partisan board appointed by the governor of Michigan with the advice and consent
of the State Senate. The Office of Commission Audit reports directly to the
Commission and is charged with overall responsibility to supervise and conduct
auditing activities of MDOT.
MDOT operates in a decentralized organization composed of seven geographic
regions, with its headquarters located in the Murray Van Wagoner Transportation
Building in Lansing, Michigan, and has responsibilities for highways, aviation,
and transit.
The Asset Management Council has a goal to expand the practice of asset
management statewide in order to more efficiently invest in Michigan’s roads and
bridges. This is done through coordination and collaboration among the member
agencies which include state, regional and local transportation and planning
organizations.
2.3.2 Stakeholders
This section describes stakeholders who use the data gathered by the VII system.
While each transportation agency has its own organizational structure and
functional responsibilities, similar functions and users are present across all
agencies.
The gathered information must be presented to all users in “real-time”, meaning
that the information is only valuable if it can be provided and acted upon quickly
enough to reduce the impact of the event as it is occurring. The information also
needs to be accurate.
Transportation agency (TA) Operators include local, regional, and state
transportation agencies throughout Michigan, and in adjoining jurisdictions.
These operators have one common objective, which is to minimize the impact of
incidents and events on the normal flow of traffic.
In order to meet this objective, operators perform the following tasks:
• Review major travel impacting incidents and events
• Assess potential impact on travelers
• Determine response actions needed
• Monitor incident or event for status changes
Transportation agency maintainers include local, regional, and state employees
who maintain the roadways and bridges within their particular jurisdiction. They

System Requirements Specification
maintain road conditions on a daily basis as well as respond to incidents to
perform cleanup and make necessary roadway repairs.
Transportation agency asset managers include local, regional, and state employees
who analyze the data and information collected about the assets in their area to
determine each agency’s annual programs and projects. Their goal is a cost-
effective use of resources within their agency.
System administrators include local, regional, and state employees who are
responsible for the administration of the systems. Their goal is to have all
collected data made available for use by the other stakeholders.
Transportation agency management includes the management personnel of the
various local, regional, and state transportation agencies. The management
personnel supervise the transportation agency staff working with both the raw and
analyzed data.
Transportation agency contractors are contract employees hired by local, regional,
or state transportation agencies to perform a specific job within the agency. These
contractors will work with the agency staff to meet the requirements of their
contract.
Travelers are all the people who use the roadways, whether driving or riding in
private or commercial vehicles. They obtain their trip information from various
sources and use it to prepare for their daily commute or for an extended trip. The
trip information may be used by the traveler for determining possible delays along
desired route(s) or choosing an alternative route or mode of transportation.
Emergency services are staffed with trained personnel who respond to emergency
incidents or major disasters both on and off the roadway system. Their primary
goal is to protect themselves and the public during the response to an incident.
The data from the roadway system will assist them initially in getting to the
incident location. After Emergency Services personnel are on-site, the data can be
used to help evaluate the impact of the incident on the current traffic and help
determine if additional resources are needed.
Researchers and university personnel assist the transportation agencies by
analyzing the collected data based on the requirements of the particular agency for
which they are working. The University of Michigan Transportation Research
Institute (UMTRI) is an example of one such group. It has worked with the
Michigan State Police Office of Highway Safety on crash investigation research.
It is important that the data used by the researchers is accurate and complete.
The Michigan Transportation Research Board (MTRB) is led by MDOT and is a
voluntary advisory body to Michigan’s transportation agencies. MTRB will assist
in the following:
• Identifying and prioritizing transportation research needs
• Interacting with other organizations that conduct and support research
• Advocating the value of research to improve Michigan’s transportation
system

VII Data Use Analysis and Processing
System Requirements Specification
• Promoting an exchange of information, ideas, and knowledge
• Helping to set the direction for annual research programs
• Evaluating annual progress
Stakeholders in DUAP-enhanced transportation system operations are almost
entirely the same as those involved in the current state of operations as noted
above.
The intent of adding new data sources is to provide a more complete dataset upon
which the transportation agencies can base operational decisions, but there are not
necessarily any new users of VII data within the agencies. The providers of VII
data are, however, new stakeholders in transportation operations.
The automobile manufacturers—original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) —
become stakeholders in DUAP because VII data becomes available to
transportation agencies only if those OEMs provide equipment and
communication systems on their vehicles for transmitting the data to the VII
network. Many of the OEMs are members of the Vehicle Infrastructure
Integration Consortium (VIIC), which is developing the on-board equipment
(OBE) and assisting the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) in
development of applications for VII infrastructure and data. OEMs are in many
cases also developing independent telematics networks from which transportation
agencies might be able to obtain data similar to that provided through the
USDOT/VIIC efforts.
The VII network (and any similar independent telematics networks) will also
introduce a network operating entity as a stakeholder to DUAP and transportation
system operations. Once the VII field infrastructure is in place, a network
operating entity will be needed to operate, monitor, and maintain the flow of VII
data and the infrastructure enabling it. The operating entity’s responsibilities in
this capacity are similar to those of a transportation agency relative to the
transportation network.
2.4 General Constraints
In its prototype DUAP applications, MDOT will be evaluating a broad range of
data uses and analyses. Some of these evaluations will benefit from being able to
link probe vehicle data directly to information about the vehicles on which the
data originates. While this ability is of tremendous value in application research,
operational policies will need to be established to protect the privacy and data
ownership of the data originators. While the USDOT VII program is addressing
policy issues for the VII network itself, MDOT will be faced with many of the
same issues as it seeks to integrate VII data into its operations.
For example, while VII probe data is “anonymized” to the extent that it is not
associated directly with a particular vehicle or driver, there are inherent
limitations to that anonymity. In the simplest such case, the VII-originated record
of a vehicle’s behavior could be uniquely correlated to a particular vehicle if it
were the only such vehicle on a roadway at a particular time and corroborated by
other observations. While this may not be a significant policy issue during system

System Requirements Specification
development and testing, or when every vehicle on the road is VII-enabled, it
could become an issue in the transition—when some, but not all vehicles are so
equipped, and are therefore more identifiable.
The question of ownership of commingled data may become an issue for DUAP-
based information. MDOT and its partner transportation agencies currently
subscribe to selected traffic, vehicle location, and weather information services
that would be blended into the DUAP data streams. While the bulk of data will be
from the VII network, other sources present opportunities for data expansion and
validation that might be necessary for DUAP to succeed. Limitations on the use or
redistribution of data from these third-party sources could hamper the usefulness
of DUAP, and will need to be considered in agreements for those services.
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
Data latency is the time delay experienced when data is sent from one point to
another. Latency enters into the data collection process in several ways:
• The time required for vehicle systems to collect and store vehicle data
• The delay between the data collection and the data transmission from the
vehicle to the roadside equipment (RSE)
• The time required for the transmission of data from the RSE to the DUAP
system
• The time required for the DUAP system to process the data and publish it
to other systems
• The time between the DUAP processing and the transmission to the end
systems
While the VII data is much more timely and complete than data currently being
processed, participants must recognize that VII data is “near real-time” data. Each
system using DUAP data must be capable of evaluating the data based on the
source and date/time stamps to determine the suitability of each data element for
the intended purpose.
Data quality may also be an issue. Vehicle sensors may be in various states of
calibration and may even function in degraded modes. Each application using the
VII and DUAP data will need to have the capability of assessing the quality of
data and making appropriate use of any available data quality flags.
Finally, the amount of data coming into DUAP from VII is highly dependent on
the amount of data collected by each vehicle, the number of VII equipped
vehicles, the number of RSE locations, and the frequency of encounters between
VII equipped vehicles with RSE equipped locations. While these factors can be
controlled during the evaluation phase of this project, only the number of RSE
locations will be within the control of agencies during the full production roll-out
of the system.

of DUAP. Data obtained by the Input Services are stored here for use by
other DUAP components.
• Computational Services – Computational Services apply logical
algorithms to incoming vehicle and traffic observations in order to
transform those observations into data that are directly applicable to
transportation management and operations processes.
• Persistent Data Services – Persistent Data Services are the long-term
memory of DUAP.

3.4 CS – Computational Services
Computational Services apply logical algorithms to incoming vehicle, traffic, weather, and roadway condition observations in
order to transform those observations into data that are directly applicable to transportation management and operations
processes.
Requirements for specific computational services may be added as they are identified in future system analyses. The research
orientation of the project and prototypical nature of the systems development make it very likely that new computational needs
will be discovered as the project progresses.

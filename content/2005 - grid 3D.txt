PRODUCT CONSTRAINTS
1.1 Purpose of the the Product
1.1.1 Background to the Project Effort
The need for a method of visualisation of biological data has been identified. Currently, there are
many groups offering many different tools for visualising data. These visualisation tools provide a
range from tabular to three-dimensional graphical views. However, a need has been identified for a
tool that can display data in a three dimensional environment, which allows the user to investigate
the data and easily see various attributes of the data at a glance.
A need for the above-mentioned tool  has been identified and, there being no applicable tool
available, a project to create such a tool was conceptualised.
The primary stakeholder (see 1.2.1) has made the case that the tool to be created is of relevance use
and there is a real need for it. This need is established through continual use of other similar tools
and a continued identification of their shortfalls.
1.1.2 Goals of the Product
We want to give the user the ability to visualise and investigate their data in a three dimensional
environment. The user should have the ability to see (at a glance) the differences of various selected
attributes of their data.
The overall goal of this product is to provide the users with something that has previously been
unavailable.

1.4 Requirements Constraints
1.4.1 Solution Constraints
The following specifies constraints on the way that the problem must be solved
 The product must be available on both Windows and Linux operating platforms
 The execution of the application must be kept on the server side.
 The solution must be produced in a timely manner – see time restrictions.
1.4.2 Implementation Environment
This section will describe the technological and physical environment that the product will be
installed.
 The product should run on a minimum of a mid-range personal computer.
 The product shall run with the minimum input tools of mouse and keyboard.
 The user must have a capability for creating tab-delimited text files.
1.4.3 Partner Applications
This section will describe some of the applications that are not part of the product, but with which
the product will, or may, collaborate.
 Microsoft Windows 98, 2000, NT and XP Operating Systems
 Linux and Solaris Operating Systems
 Matlab – used for some of the pre-product data generations. Matlab can also be used for
manipulating the format of the product's required data.
 Tomcat/Apache/Ant – possibly to be used for product deployment
1.4.4 How Long to Develop?
The Grid 3D application was originally developed to be included for a scientific paper to be
published at some point in March 2005. It was, therefore, essential that the application be ready by
then. The motivation for developing the application within this short time frame was to, firstly,
included it in the paper, but also to produce an original product in a constantly advancing genre.

1.5 Naming Conventions and Definitions
This section shall provide a dictionary containing the meaning of all the name used within this
requirements specification document.
 Biological data – data of a biological scientific nature generated by some product or process
(external to the Grid 3D application). To use the biological data with the Grid 3D
application, it must be formatted in the specified manner (see         ).
 Demonstrator – refers to a user of the Grid 3D application. The demonstrator uses the three
dimensional view generated by the application to demonstrate one or more properties of the
data to any other person.
 Grid 3D – the application for which this document contains the requirements. For a detailed
representation of the Grid 3D application, please refer to the Design document.
 Identifier – refers to a user of the Grid 3D application. The identifier use the application to
identify different “points of interest”. For example, a point that is not close to any other point
may be of interest. An identifier may become an investigator.
 Investigator – refers to a user of the Grid 3D application. The investigator uses the
application in order to find detailed information about specific points. An investigator may
originate as an identifier.
1.6 Assumptions
This section contains a list of assumptions that are to be made by the developers.
 The users have the computing skill for basic operation of one of the operating systems
documented in 1.4.3. Basic operation entails:
• starting and terminating an operating system session
• use of a Java-enabled internet browser
• competent use of keyboard and mouse
• basic file handling
• command line input skills
 The users have access to a minimum specification work station on which to run the product.
See 3.3 for minimum requirements for the work station.

2.1.1.2 Running
The context diagram above represents the Grid 3D application during the initialisation stages. It is
important to differentiate this with the work context for the application in a state of running. The
following diagram aims to describe the work context for the application when it is being run by the
users (identified above). In the following diagram, the users are grouped as one entity. This is for
convenience only and should be thought of as separate entities. However, the work context applies
to each of them in the same manner and, therefore, have been grouped to further the simplicity and
understandability of the diagram.

2.1.3 Product Boundary
This section aims to generate some use cases for the Grid 3D application. These shall be generated
from the events list contained in 2.1.2. It is hoped that use cases can be given that cover all the
events listed in 2.1.2. With this in mind, the use cases will cover more than one event as more than
one event can be captured with a single use-case.

2.2 Functional and Data Requirements
2.2.1 Functional Requirements
This section describes the functional requirements for the Grid 3D application. Each functional
requirement should have a fit criterion in order to make it possible to test whether the requirement is
implemented as specified in the delivered product.
 The product shall plot the data points in a scientifically correct manner.
 The grid axis should be labelled correctly according to the input from the data file.
 Data points should be coloured in accordance to the cluster number (contained in the data
file)
 The product should be able to handle up to 2000 data points.
 A single click of the mouse over a data point should bring up the name of the data point.
 A double-click of the mouse over the data point should cause the application to display all
the data point's details.
 The product should allow multiple points to clicked so that multiple names can be displayed.
 The product should allow the grid to be oriented by the user. Rotation, zoom and move
functions should be employed.
2.2.2 Data Requirements
The use of the Grid 3D application involves the user supplying a data file. This data file contains all
the information of the points that are to be plotted.
The data file should contain:
 A name for the data point
 3 parameters from which the data point is to be plotted
 A single parameter to designate the colour of the point. This is the attribute that is to be used
as the comparison.
 A description for the data point.
In order for the grid to reflect the nature of the user's data, the system should allow for the user to
specify their own axis. With this in mind, the first row of the data file should contain the column
headings. The following table proposes the format for the data file.

Y_Title
Z_Title

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
3.1 Look and Feel Requirements
The product is to be used primarily by research scientists and therefore must have a look and feel
appropriate for this use.
These requirements are:
 The points should be large enough to see and select
 The points should not be too big, so as to distort the overall pattern of the point spread.
 The axis should be clearly labelled and easily recognised after the grid has been oriented into
a different position.
 The application should be coloured so that the screen shots can be printed out clearly (i.e.,
black on white background).
 The application should be intuitive and not require any specialist training.
3.2 Performance Requirements
This section aims to specify some of the timing and performance constraints to which the product
will aim to adhere.
 The program should start within 30 seconds
• This depends on the number of data points that are to be plotted.
 The interaction with the data points should have a delay of no longer than 2 seconds.
 The response to a change in the orientation should be fast enough to avoid interrupting the
user's flow of thought.
